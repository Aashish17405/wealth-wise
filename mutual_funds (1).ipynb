This is a 2-hour \\nconversation and I think this is one of the most thought-provoking and \\nstimulating conversations I’ve heard in a while. The topics discussed are quite \\nscattered and covers a diverse set of topics, but it has a great flow to it with \\none thing leading to another. I’m awestruck with Naval’s multi-disciplinary \\napproach to many things in life including inner peace, creativity, capitalism, \\nand of course, wealth creation. The granular clarity he has on these topics is \\nquite impressive. I’d suggest you check out the  podcast/YouTube video  if you’ve \\nnot already done that yet. \\nFor obvious reasons, the wealth creation bit lingered on in my mind for a \\nwhile. I was thinking about what Naval said in this podcast and it resonated \\nwith everything I have ever learned and experienced with money and my own \\npursuit to generate wealth. I’m nowhere close to the ‘financial freedom’ state \\nhe describes in the podcast, but at least I know that I’m not deviating much \\nfrom the track. While I continue this journey, I thought why not share some of \\nmy experiences and learning with you all. \\nHence this topic on ‘Personal Finance’. \\nWhen you think about personal finance, it o\\x00en circles around planning your \\nfinancials today, so that you have a better tomorrow. While some can do this  \\n\\n \\nthemselves (or so they believe), few consult a financial advisor to chart this \\nmap for them. However, I’m not a big fan of approaching a financial advisor \\nto help you chart a plan for yourself and your family. You should be able to do \\nthis yourself and your family. \\nA\\x00er all, you know your family and their requirements best. You know what is \\ngood for the family and what is not. You work hard for your family today and \\ndream of a secure future for them. \\nYour ‘Financial Advisor’, won’t do any of this. \\nHe is most likely eager to peddle you a financial product that will earn him a \\ngood return. He will do the same with you and 0 other clients he may have. \\nSo eventually, the onus is on you to secure your family’s and your own \\nfinancial wellbeing. Remember, this is called ‘Personal’ finance for a reason. \\nIts best kept personal and dealt with care and diligence. \\nGood news is, this is not rocket science. If you have the skills to do basic \\narithmetic, then half the battle is won. The rest of the work is just the \\napplication part where you’ll figure what is good and what is not. \\nThis is exactly the objective of this module. At the end of this module, you will \\nbe in a position to do these things – \\nDevelop a deeper understanding of financial products and what goes under \\nthe hood \\nSet up a financial goal and work towards achieving that \\nIdentify financial setbacks and address towards correcting them \\nI hope you are as excited as I’m about this module! \\n  \\n \\n1.2– I’m not ready yet \\nGetting my first job was a struggle. I spent 6-8 month meeting tons of people, \\ndesperately looking for a job. I finally landed up with a ‘job’ to do. This was \\nmy first job and it was special. A\\x00er working for a month, I got my first pay \\ncheque ever and I was ecstatic. I felt responsible for the first time in my life. \\nI had a bunch of things planned with my first pay. Right from buying my mother a saree to taking my girlfriend (now my wife) out for dinner J. Being in \\na position to do things for your loved ones always feels good. \\nA\\x00er all the expenses, I still had some money le\\x00 in the account, albeit very \\nlittle.  \\nA good friend of mine suggested that I should invest that money. I brushed \\naway his advise, thinking that the money le\\x00 in my account was very little \\nand would not make any diﬀerence whatsoever. However, I convinced myself \\nthat I would start saving next month onwards. \\n  \\n \\nAs predictable as it can get, next month to a similar story. I spent all the salary \\nmoney and had nothing le\\x00 to save. No points of guessing, this continued for \\nyears and I never saved a dime. \\nEven today, I regret doing this. In fact, this probably is one of the top regrets \\nin my life. I wish I had started saving early on in life. \\nI’m sure most of your reading this may relate to my story. We all brush aside \\nsaving money today because the ‘amount’ of money we intend to save is very \\nsmall. We all keep waiting to receive a sizable amount of money so that we \\ncan start our savings journey with that. \\nThis never happens and unfortunately, we never start saving in life. \\nHere is an advise – even if it is a small amount, save it. This will make a huge \\ndiﬀerence in your financial life. \\nAllow me to tell you the story of 3 sisters to help you understand why you \\nneed to start saving early in life. \\nA father had triplet daughters. On their 20 th  birthday, the father declared that \\nhe would pay each daughter a sum of Rs.50,000/- on their birthday, till they \\nwere 65 years old. They were free to use this money in whichever way they \\nwanted. \\nAs a good father, he also suggested to his daughters that they could invest \\nthis money in a promissory note, which would pay them a return of 12% \\ncompounded year on year, with a condition that once invested, they were \\nprohibited to withdraw that money till they turn 65. \\nAlthough they were triplets, their attitude towards money and savings were \\nvery diﬀerent. Here is how each daughter utilized this money – \\n  \\n \\nThe first daughter started investing right away i.e on her 20 th  birthday. She \\ninvested the first nine 0Ks that she received in the promissory note, and then \\nthe remaining 0K that she received (from 28th birthday to her 6th birthday) \\nwere all spent on frivolous things. \\nThe second daughter initially spent all the money she received. However, on \\nher 28 th  birthday, she got a little serious. She decided to save the same \\namount as her other sister. So she saved 0K from her 28 th  birthday till her \\n36 th  birthday, and the money she received from 37 th  to 6 th  was spent. \\nThe 3 rd  sister was a bit casual till her 28 th  birthday. She spent all the money \\nshe received from her dad. However, on her 28 th  birthday, she got a little \\nserious and decided to invest the 0k cash all the way up to 6 years. \\nHere is a summary of what each sister did with the money – \\n  \\n  \\nThe first sister saved for the first 9 years (between 20 th  to 3 th  birthday) \\ntotaling Rs.450,000/-. \\nThe 2 nd  sister saved for 9 years (between her 28 th  birthday to 3 th  birthday), \\ntotaling Rs.450,000/- \\nThe 3 rd  sister started saving from her 28 th  birthday, but saved all the way till \\nher 5 th  birthday, totaling a sum of Rs.1,900,000/- \\nI have a question for you now – on the 5 th  birthday, which sister do you think \\nwould have saved the most? Remember, once the money gets invested the \\npromissory note, it gets locked till the 5th birthday and do not forget the \\npromissory note gives a 12% compounded return year on year. \\nPause and think about it for a moment. \\n  \\n \\nChances are here is how you’d think about this – \\nThe first sister saved too little, very early on, so she would not have saved \\nmuch \\nThe 2 nd  sister again has saved very little very randomly, so she may not have \\nmuch on her 65 th  birthday \\nThe 3 rd  sister, although started late, has saved quite a bit and continued to \\nsave for the entire duration, hence she must have the highest savings on her \\n65th birthday \\nThis is expected (in fact I’d be surprised if it is anything else) as we humans \\nsee things in a very linear fashion. Here we equate the future value of our \\nsavings to the amount of money saved today. But there are two other \\nvariables at play here – time and return, both of these when concocted \\ntogether, works in a beautiful nonlinear way. \\nSo, here are how the numbers stack up for the 3 sister problem, the numbers \\nmay put you oﬀ guard so hold your breath – \\nThe 3 rd  sister saves 19L, which grows to a massive 3.05Crs by the time she turns 65 \\nThe 2 nd  sister saves 4.5L, which grows to an impressive 1.98Crs by the time \\nshe turns 65 \\nThe 1 st  sister saves 4.5L, however, she ends up with a whopping 4.89Crs by the \\ntime she turns 65! \\nAre you confused? \\nI’m sure some of you are. So here is what I want you to note – \\n  \\n \\nThe first and 2 nd  sister saved similar amounts, but the diﬀerence was the \\namount of time they both gave their money to grow. The first sister gave full \\n45 years for the investment to grow, but the 2 nd  sister gave only 3 years. See \\nthe diﬀerence it makes? This is the reason why I regret not starting to save \\nearly on in my life \\nThe 3 rd  sister ends up with the 2 nd  highest corpus, but for to that happen she \\nhad to save for a very long time. But please note, this still does not match up \\nto the 1 st  sister’s corpus. \\nSo if you are someone like me, who missed savings during my early days, \\nthen the best option we have now is to save for a really long time. \\nI hope by now, I’ve convinced you why you need to start saving early. By \\nstarting early, you use time to your advantage and it does play a major role. \\nWait for a second – how did I calculate the growth of money for each sister? \\nHow did I figure sister 1 saved 4.9Cr and sister 2 saved 1.9Cr? \\nWell, this is calculated by applying the core concept of ‘Time value of money’. \\nTime value of money is the central theme of personal finance. Hence, for this \\nreason, we need to understand this concept right at the beginning. So in the \\nnext chapter, we will discuss time value and its application in more detail. \\nDownload  the excel sheet used in the chapter below.    \\n  \\n \\nKey takeaways from this chapter \\n● Personal finance is best when kept personal to oneself. \\n● Eventually, you as an individual should be able to build a \\nfinancial plan for yourself and your family \\n● Savings early on in life makes a huge diﬀerence in the savings \\ncorpus at the end of the tenure \\n● Time value of money plays a key role in personal finance.  \\n  \\n \\nCHAPTER  2 \\nPersonal Finance Math \\ue081Part 1\\ue082  \\n2.1 – Simple Interest \\nWhen it comes to personal finance, one of the key things to learn is the math \\nthat surrounds this topic. Once you understand the math bit, the rest is just \\nthe application of it and life becomes easy a\\x00er that. \\nIn this chapter, I’ll try and explain the most basic math involved starting from \\nsimple interest. I know this is explained across multiple chapters across \\nmultiple modules in Varsity, but for the sake of completeness let me include \\nall of it in one single chapter. \\nLet us run through an imaginary transaction, my guess is that this a familiar \\nsituation for most of us.  \\n  \\n\\n \\nImagine that one of your friends needs money urgently and he approaches \\nyou for it. Being a friend, you agree to help him with the money but being a \\ncapitalist at heart, you also expect your friend to pay you ‘interest’ on the \\ncash you lend to him. I know we don’t usually ask a friend to pay us interest, \\nbut let’s just assume he is a friend whom you’d like to help, but not at the \\nopportunity cost of your money. \\nThe transaction details are below – \\nAmount – Rs.100,000/- \\nTenure – 5 years \\nInterest (%) – 10 \\nAs you can see, your friend agrees to repay Rs.100,000/- over a 5 year period \\nand also agrees to pay you an interest of 10%. \\nGiven this, how much money will you make at the end of 5 years? Let’s do the \\nmath and find out the details. \\nRemember, the yearly interest is paid on the principal amount. \\nPrincipal = Rs.100,000/- \\nInterest = 10% \\nYearly interest amount = 10% * 100,000 \\n= Rs.10,000/- \\nHere is how the math looks – \\n  \\nYear Principal \\nOutstanding \\nInterest \\npayable \\n  \\nSo as you can see, you can earn Rs.50,000/- in total interest from this \\npayment. The amount you earn from the interest can also be calculated by \\napplying a simple formula, which you may remember from your school days – \\nAmount = Principal * Time * Return  Where the return is the interest percentage. \\nAmount = Rs.100,000 * 5 * 10% \\n=  Rs.50,000/- \\nI’m sure you’d agree that this is quite straightforward and most of you would \\nremember that this is simple interest. \\nIn simple interest, the interest gets charged only on the outstanding principal. \\nImagine a bank transaction, you deposit Rs.100,000/- in a bank’s Fixed \\nDeposit scheme, which promises to pay you a simple interest of 10% year on \\nyear for 5 years. At the end of 5 years, you’ll earn Rs.50,000/- as interest \\nincome. The math is still the same. \\n  \\n01  Rs.100,000/-  Rs.10,000/- \\n02  Rs.100,000/-  Rs.10,000/- \\n03  Rs.100,000/-  Rs.10,000/- \\n04  Rs.100,000/-  Rs.10,000/- \\n05  Rs.100,000/-  Rs.10,000/- \\nTotal Interest received  Rs.50,000/- \\n \\nBanks don’t pay simple interest, they pay compound interest. What do you \\nthink is the diﬀerence between simple interest and compound interest? \\n2.2 – Compound interest \\nCompound interest works diﬀerently compared to simple interest. If \\nsomeone agrees to pay you compound interest, then it essentially means that \\nthe person or the entity is agreeing to pay you interest on the interest already \\nearned. \\nLet’s figure this out with the same example discussed above. The transaction \\ndetails are as follows – \\nAmount – Rs.100,000/- \\nTenure – 5 years \\nInterest (%) – 10 \\nInterest type – Compound Interest (compounded annually) \\nThe math is as follows – \\nYear 1 \\nAt the end of 1 st  year, you are entitled to receive a 10% interest on the \\nprincipal outstanding and previous interest (if any). For a moment assume \\nyou are closing this at the end of the 1 st  years, then you would receive the \\nprincipal amount plus the interest applicable on the principal amount. \\nAmount = Principal + (Principal * Interest), this can be simplified to \\n= Principal * (1+ interest) \\n  \\n \\nHere, (1+interest) is the ‘interest’ part and the principal is obviously the \\nprincipal. Applying this – \\n= 100,000 *(1+10%) \\n= 110,000 \\nYear 2 \\nNow assume, you want to close this in the 2 nd  year instead of the first, here is \\nhow much you’d get back – \\nRemember, you are supposed to get paid interest on the interest earned in \\nthe first year, hence – \\nPrincipal *(1+ Interest)* (1+Interest) \\nThe green bit is the amount receivable at the end of 1 st  year, and the blue bit \\nis the interest applicable for the 2 nd  year. \\nWe can simplify the above equation – \\n= Principal *(1+ Interest)^(2) \\n= 100,000*(1+10%)^(2) \\n= 121,000 \\nYear 3 \\nIn the 3 rd  year, you’d get interest on the 1 st  two year’s interest as well. The \\nmath – \\nPrincipal *(1+ interest) *(1+interest)*(1+interest) \\n  \\n \\nThe green bit is the amount receivable at the end of 2 years, and the blue bit \\nis the interest applicable for the 3 rd  year. \\nWe can simplify the above equation – \\n= Principal *(1+ Interest)^(3) \\n= 100,000*(1+10%)^(3) \\n= 133,100 \\nWe can generalize this – \\nP*(1+R)^(n) , where – \\nP = Principal \\nR = Interest rate \\nN = Tenure \\nSo, if you were to have this open for the entire 5 years, you’d receive – \\n= 100,000*(1+10%)^(5) \\n= Rs.161,051/- \\nContrast the diﬀerence between the 50K received in simple interest versus \\nthe Rs.61,051/- received via compound interest. \\nCompound interest and compounded return work magic in finance. At the \\nend of the day, every aspect of personal finance boils down to the \\ncompounded return. For this reason, I think it is best to spend some more \\ntime trying to understand the concept of compounding of money. \\n2.3 – Compounded returns \\n  \\n \\nThe concept of compounded return is similar to compound interest. The \\nconcept of return and interest is very similar, just like the two sides of the \\nsame coin. The interest is what you pay when you borrow money in any form \\nand the return is what you earn when you invest your money in any asset. \\nTherefore, if you understand interest, then it is easy to understand the return. \\nIn this section, you will learn about how the return is measured. Based on the \\ntime horizon of your investment, the return measurement diﬀers. \\nYou will use the  absolute  method to measure the return if your investment \\nhorizon is less than a year. Otherwise, if your investment horizon is more than \\na year, you will use CAGR or the  compounded annual growth rate , to \\nmeasure returns. \\nI guess the diﬀerence in absolute and CAGR is best understood with an example. \\nAssume you invested Rs.100,000/- on 1 st  Jan 2019 in a financial instrument \\nwhich yields you a 10% return (per year) and you withdraw this investment a \\nyear later. How much money do you make? \\nQuite straight forward as you can imagine – \\nYou will make 10% of 100,000 which is Rs.10,000/-, in other words, your \\ninvestment has grown by 10% on a year on year basis. This is the absolute \\nreturn. This is straightforward because the time under consideration is 1 year \\nor 365 days. \\nNow, what if the same investment was held for 3 years instead of 1 year, and \\nwhat if instead of a simple return of 10%, the return was compounded \\nannually at 10%? How much money would you make at the end of 3 years? \\n  \\n \\nTo calculate this, we simply have to apply the growth rate formula – \\nAmount = Principal*(1+return)^(time) \\nWhich as you realize is the same formula used while calculating the \\ncompound interest. Applying this formula – \\n100,000*(1+10%)^(3) \\n=  Rs.133,100/- \\nReferring to the previous section, if you were to charge compound interest, \\nthen this is the same amount of interest you receive from your friend in the 3 rd \\nyear. \\nContinuing on the same lines, here is another question – \\nIf you invest Rs.100,000/- and receive Rs.133,100/- a\\x00er 3 years, then what is \\nthe growth rate of your investment? \\nTo answer this question, we just need to reorganize this formula – \\nAmount = Principal*(1+return)^(time) \\nand solve for ‘ return’. \\nBy doing so, the formula reworks itself to – \\nReturn  =  [(Amount/Principal)^(1/time)] – 1 \\nReturn here is the growth rate or the CAGR. \\nApplying this to the problem – \\nCAGR = [(133100/100000)^(1/3)]-1 \\n=  10%   \\n \\n2.4 – The compounding effect \\nApparently, Albert Einstein once described ‘compound interest’ as the 8 th \\nwonder of the world. I guess he could not describe it any better. To \\nunderstand why you need to understand the compound interest in \\nconjunction with time. \\nCompounding in the finance world refers to the ability of money to grow, \\ngiven that the gains of year 1 get reinvested for year 2, gains of year 2 \\ngets reinvested for year 3, so on and so forth. \\nFor example, consider you invest Rs.100 which is expected to grow at \\n20% year on year (recall this is also called the CAGR or simply the \\ngrowth rate). At the end of the first year, the money grows to Rs.120. \\nAt the end of year 1, you have two options – \\nLet Rs.20 in profits remain invested along with the original principal of \\nRs.100 or \\nWithdraw the profits of Rs.20 \\nYou decide not to withdraw Rs.20 profit; instead, you decide to reinvest \\nthe money for the 2 nd  year. At the end of the 2 nd  year, Rs.120 grows at \\n20% to Rs.144. At the end of 3 rd  year, Rs.144 grows at 20% to Rs.173. \\nSo on and so forth. \\nCompare this with withdrawing Rs.20 profits every year. Had you opted \\nto withdraw Rs.20 every year than at the end of the 3 rd  year the profits \\ncollected would be Rs. 60. \\nHowever, since you decided to stay invested, the profits at the end of 3 \\nyears are Rs.173/-. This is good Rs.13 or 21.7% over Rs.60 earnt \\nbecause you opted to do nothing and decided to stay invested. \\n  \\n \\nThis is called the  compounding effect . \\nLet us take this analysis a little further, have a look at the chart below:  \\nThe chart above shows how Rs.100 invested at 20% grows over a \\n10-year period. \\nIn the next chapter, we will understand the other crucial concept in \\npersonal finance – Time value of money. \\nKey takeaways from this chapter \\n● Simple interest is the interest that gets paid only on the outstanding principal \\n● Compound interest is paid on both interest and the \\nprincipal outstanding \\n● Interest and return are like two sides of the same coin \\n● Absolute return is a measure of the growth in return when \\nyour investment if for less than a year \\n  \\n \\n● Compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) is the measure \\nof your return when your investment duration is more than \\na year \\n● Compounding works best when you give your investments \\nenough time to grow   \\n  \\n \\nCHAPTER  3 \\nPersonal Finance Math (Part 2)  \\n3.1 – Money today versus money tomorrow           For a moment, assume a friend of yours is in a very generous mood and \\nhe gives you two offers, of which you have to select one of them. \\nOption A  – He gives you Rs.10,000/- right away \\nOption B  – He promises to give your Rs.10,000/- exactly two year from \\nnow \\nTo add a little twist, assume you do not need the money today, but in two \\nyears, you are planning to buy a new car. \\nWill you take the money today even though you do not need the money \\nor will you take the money two years from now, when you would need \\nthe money? \\n  \\n\\n \\nBy the way, there is no question of your friend backing out on his \\npromise after two years, he is a good guy and he will certainly give you the promised money. \\nSo given these two options, and the other things around it, which one \\nare you likely to choose? \\nIf I were to guess, most of you reading this will opt for Option B. The \\nrationale being, that there is no real need for money today, so if you \\nwere to take the money today, you’d spend that money on unnecessary \\nthings and waste the money. Hence you are better off taking that money \\ntwo years later. \\nAssuming the above were to be true, here are few questions to you – \\n1. Does it make sense to equate money across timelines i.e money \\ntoday versus money tomorrow? \\n2. How do you move money across a timeline to ensure we compare \\nthe right value of money? \\nTo make the right decision, you need to have clarity on moving money \\nacross the timeline. You need to compare the value of money today \\nversus the value of money tomorrow. \\nThe objective of this chapter is to help you understand just this i.e to \\nhelp you compare money across different timelines. \\nHopefully, by the end of this chapter, you will be better equipped to make \\na sensible decision concerning your friend’s generous offer and of \\ncourse for more serious things in life as investment planning J \\nThe discussion we are about to have is a core financial concept called \\nthe ‘ Time value   of money ’ (TVM). The time value of money finds its \\napplication across many different areas of finance including project \\n  \\n \\nfinance, insurance planning, equity derivatives, valuations, and of course \\npersonal finance. \\nThe time value of money has two components – the present value of \\nmoney and the future value of money. \\n3.2 – Present value of money \\nWe all buy assets with a hope that it will generate a decent return over \\ntime. For example, if I were to buy a piece of land today then I would \\nexpect it to grow to a certain value in 15 years. The amount of money I \\nwill receive when I sell this piece of land in 15 years will have a very \\ndifferent value when compared to the same value today. \\nThe concept of  Present value  helps you understand the value of the \\nfunds you are likely to receive in the future in today’s terms. \\nSounds confusing? Probably :) \\nLet’s understand this with an example. \\nConsider that you purchased a piece of land for Rs.15,000,000/- today \\nand held it for 15 years. After 15 years, you sell the land at \\nRs.75,000,000/-. On the face of it, this looks great, after all, you’ve made \\na five times return on this. \\nBut here is an important question you need to ask yourself.  How \\nvaluable is Rs.75,000,000/- that you will receive 15 years from now, in \\ntoday’s terms? \\nWhat if in 15 years from today, Rs.75,000,000/- is less valuable than \\nRs.15,000,000/-? \\nTo find the answer to this, we need to understand two thing – \\n  \\n \\nWhat is my risk-free opportunity cost today? \\nGiven the risk-free opportunity cost, what is the amount that needs to be \\ninvested today, such that it grows to Rs.75,000,000/- in 15 years. \\nThe answer to the 2 nd  question is, in fact, today’s equivalent of \\nRs.75,000,000/- that you’d receive in 15 years. So let us figure this out. \\nWe are talking about a 15-year time horizon here. \\nThe opportunity cost is the equivalent of what else can be done with the \\nfunds available if we choose not to invest this money in the real estate \\ndeal. The opportunity cost can be found out by figuring out the risk-free \\nrate in the economy and adding a risk premium over and above the \\nrisk-free rate. \\nSo the opportunity cost – \\nOpportunity cost = Risk free rate + Risk premium \\nThe risk-free rate is the rate at which our money can grow without any \\nrisk. Of course, we can endlessly argue that there is nothing like a true \\nrisk-free rate, but for the sake of this discussion, let’s assume that the \\nrisk-free rate is the Government’s 15-year bond. Usually, the \\nGovernments are expected not to default on their payments/repayments, \\nhence the Government or the Sovereign bond is a good proxy for the \\nrisk-free rate. \\nHere is a snapshot of all the available Sovereign bonds – \\n  \\n  \\nI’ve highlighted the 2034 bond since we are interested in a 15-year time \\nhorizon. As the highlight indicates, the coupon rate is 7.5%. Again for \\nsimplicity, let us keep the bid-ask yield aside, we will anyway discuss \\nthese things in more detail when we deal with bonds. For now, you need \\nto understand that the risk-free rate for the next 15 years is 7.5%. \\nTo figure out the opportunity cost, we can add a risk premium of 1.5-2% \\nmore. The risk premium really depends on many things, keeping it \\nsimple for now. So, the opportunity cost would be – \\n7.5% + 1.5% \\n=  9%. \\nNow that we have our opportunity cost sorted, we now need to answer \\nthe 2 nd  question i.e to figure the amount that we need to invest today at \\n9%, such that it will grow to Rs.75,000,000/- at the end of 15 years. \\nA trial and error method can figure this amount. Alternatively, we can use \\nthe concept of ‘ discounting ’, wherein we discount Rs.75,000,000/- at \\n9%, which will give us the same answer. \\nThe opportunity cost at which we discount is the ‘ discount rate ’. \\n  \\n \\nBy discounting we are essentially equating the future value of money \\n(Rs.75,000,000/- in this example) to its equivalent value in today’s terms, \\nalso called the ‘ Present Value ’ of money. \\nThe present value forumla is – \\nPresent value = Future value / (1+ discount rate ) ^ (time) \\nWe know, \\nFuture value = Rs.75,000,000/- \\nDiscount rate = 9% \\nTime = 15% \\nWe can plug these numbers in the equation – \\n= 75,000,000 / (1+9%)^(15) \\n= 20,590,353 \\nThis means, the present value of Rs.75,000,000/- is Rs.20,590,353/-. In \\nother words, Rs.75,000,000/- in today’s terms is the same as Rs. \\n20,590,353/- in 15 years. \\nGiven this, if someone makes an offer to buy the property at \\nRs.20,590,353/- today, then it is as good as receiving Rs.75,000,000/- in \\n15 years, because if Rs.20,590,353/- invested at the opportunity cost of \\n9%, will yield Rs.75,000,000/- in 15 years. \\nThe concept of present value is very critical in finance and so is the \\nconcept of the future value of money, which we will discuss next. \\n3.3 – Future value of money \\n  \\n \\nThe future value of money is simply the inverse of the present value of \\nmoney. Going by the real estate example, the future value of money \\nhelps us find an answer to a question like this – \\nWhat will be the value of Rs.20,590,353/- in 15 years from now? \\nTo find an answer to this question, we again must find out the \\nopportunity cost. Irrespective of future value or present value problems \\nwe are trying to solve, the opportunity cost remains the same. \\nSo, 9% will be the opportunity cost. \\nTo find the future value of money, we must compound the amount at the given rate of opportunity cost. \\nRecall from the previous chapter, the compounding formula – = P*(1+R)^(n),  which is also the future value, therefor – \\nFuture value =   P*(1+R)^(n) \\nWhere, \\nP = Amount R = opportunity cost \\nN = Time period \\nApplying this, \\n= 20,590,353 * (1+9%)^(15) \\nNow, before I post the answer to the above question, what does your \\nintuition say the answer is? Remember, when we worked out the present value of Rs.75,000,000/- at \\na 9% discount rate for 15 years, the answer was 20,590,353. Now, we \\n  \\n \\nare trying to do the exact opposite i.e compound 20,590,353 at 9% for \\n15 years. So the answer has to be 75,000,000. When you do this math – \\n= 20,590,353 * (1+9%)^(15) \\n=  75,000,000 \\nThis is the future value of money. \\nSo in simple terms, if you had an option to receive 75,000,000 after 15 \\nyears or 20,590,353 today, then essentially both of these are the same \\ndeal. \\n3.4 – The offer \\nWe started this chapter with a hypothetical situation. Your generous \\nfriend gives you two options – \\nOption A  – He gives you Rs.10,000/- right away \\nOption B  – He promises to give your Rs.10,000/- exactly two year from \\nnow \\nChances are that you selected option B. However, can we tackle this \\nsituation better? Now that we know the concept of the time value of \\nmoney aka the present and future value of money? Of course, we can. \\nThe problem here is that we are trying to compare the value of \\nRs.10,000/- today versus Rs.10,000/- two years from now. \\nNow, if we were to opt for option A, we will have an option to invest this \\nmoney in an interest-bearing instrument and grow this money. As of \\ntoday, a two year fixed deposit will yield anywhere close to 7.5%. Given \\nthis, we now have to find out the future value of Rs.10,000/- at 7.5% \\nopportunity rate (or the compounding rate). \\n  \\n \\n= 10000*(1+7.5%)^(2) =  Rs.11,556.25/- \\nThis also means, that if we were to accept option B, we would be \\nessentially accepting a value much lesser than Rs.10,000/-. A fair deal \\nhere would be either Rs.10,000/- today or Rs.11,556.25/- two years from \\nnow! \\nThis also leads us to one of the most important conclusions in finance – \\nMoney today is far valuable than money tomorrow because today we \\nhave an option to invest this money and grow it at a risk-free rate. \\n3.5 – Real-life applications \\nSo before we wrap up this chapter, let us consider a few real-life (like) \\nsituations and apply the concept of Future Value (FV) and Present Value \\n(PV) of money. These are just made-up situations, you will appreciate \\nthe application of FV and PV better later in this module when the \\nexample will be probably more tangible. \\nQuestion  – So assume you are saving for your daughter’s education at \\na foreign university. She is ten years today, and she is expected to go to \\nthe US when she is 25 years old, which is 15 years away. The tuition \\nfees including the cost of living are expected to be roughly \\nRs.6,500,000/-. Given this, how much should you have today? \\nAnswer  – When you have a situation like this, the first thing to do is to \\nfigure out if this is a present value or a future value situation. This may \\nnot be very obvious at the surface, so this needs a bit more \\nunderstanding. One easy way to figure that out is by analyzing the \\nnumbers. \\n  \\n \\nWe know the cost of education in 15 years will be Rs.6,500,000/-, so \\nwhat is clear at this point is the future value of our cash requirement. \\nGiven this, we need to figure out the present value of this cash \\nrequirement, so that we can save an appropriate amount today. We can \\ndo this by the simple present value formula we just learned – \\nPresent value = Future value / (1+ discount rate ) ^ (time) \\nThe 7.5%, 15 year Government bond is a good proxy for the discount \\nrate, so we will use the same. \\nPresent value = 6,500,000/(1+7.5%)^(15) \\n=  Rs.21,96,779/- \\nSo in today’s rate, if we can manage to deposit a sum of Rs.21,96,779/-, \\nwe will have the required target funds in 15 years. \\nOf course, some of you reading this may be in an exact situation \\nwherein you’d be saving for your child’s future education. Do note, this is \\nnot the only way to save for it. The different ways to accumulate that \\ncorpus is the objective of this module, but for now, we are only \\nconcerned about gaining clarity about the concept of the present value \\nof money. \\nLet us take up an example of the future value of money before we wrap \\nthis chapter up. Here is a situation you may be familiar – \\nQuestion  – Your dad’s close friend at the office also doubles up as a \\nwheeler-dealer, and never hesitates to offer a financial deal/scheme. He \\ncomes home for a cup of tea and also decides to sell a financial product \\nto the family. He says you need to invest a lumpsum amount of \\n  \\n \\nRs.200,000/- today and in 15 years, the family will get a gain of \\nRs.450,000/-. \\nSo will you take up this deal and invest in it? \\nAnswer  – This is a tricky question because this can be solved by the \\napplication of both future value and present value concept. We will stick \\nto the future value application. Quite straightforward this one – \\nInvestment required today – Rs.200,000/- \\nExpected value from this investment – Rs.450,000/- \\nGiven this, and the 7.5% opportunity cost, we need to figure if this \\ninvestment makes sense. We will extrapolate Rs.200,000/- at the \\nopportunity cost to figure this. \\nFuture value = 200000*(1+7.5%)^15 \\n=  Rs. 591,775.5 \\nContrast this with the Rs.450,000/-, and the deal falls apart. You’ll have \\nto politely ask your dad’s friend to enjoy his cup of tea and leave. \\nNow, here is something for you to think about – how will you solve the \\nabove problem by applying the concept of the present value of money? \\nThink about it and leave your comments below.    \\n  \\n \\nKey takeaways from this chapter \\n● Money today is always more valuable than money \\ntomorrow because money today can be invested in \\ninterest-bearing instruments \\n● The time value of money is a core concept of personal \\nfinance \\n● Time value includes the present value and the future value \\nof money \\n● The present value of money helps us figure the value of a \\nfuture sum in today’s terms \\n● Present value = Future value / (1+ discount rate ) ^ (time) \\n● The discount rate = opportunity cost + risk premium \\n● Give a certain amount of money today, the future value of \\nmoney helps us figure out its value at a future date \\n● Future value of money and the compound interest concept \\nworks the same way \\n● Future value = P*(1+R)^(n) \\n● R in the above formula is the opportunity cost, whereas \\nthe R used in compound interest is the growth rate. This is \\nthe only difference between Future value and compound \\ninterest. \\n  \\n \\nCHAPTER  4 \\nThe retirement problem (Part 1)  \\n4.1 – Defining the problem \\nIf you think about it, success in personal finance boils down to three things – \\nYour ability to see through the numbers \\nYour risk-taking ability, and \\nCommon sense \\nI hope that the previous two chapters have laid down a foundation, which will \\nhelp you look through the numbers. \\nThe risk-taking ability is merely a function of your knowledge and the way you continuously expand it. The more you read and understand, the more you get \\nfamiliar with risk and the better equipped you are to handle risk. The extent \\nof risk you assume can make or break your financial fortunes. Of course, we \\nwill discuss more as we proceed through this module. \\nCommon sense is something applicable to all aspect of life and not just \\nfinance; we will leave it at that 🙂 So, given these three key points, we will now steer our way into learning the \\nvast set of things that make up personal finance, and hopefully, this will help \\nus develop our instincts on all the three counts required for success in \\npersonal finance. \\n  \\n\\n \\nFinding a starting point to start this journey is a challenge given that the \\nvastness of this topic. Hence, in my opinion, the best way to proceed is by \\nidentifying a real-life financial problem and then finding a solution for it. \\nThe process of finding the solution will open up many diﬀerent learning \\nwindows, which will help us understand the core concepts of personal \\nfinance. \\nSo let’s get started. \\nI’m assuming most of you would be in diﬀerent stages of your working life, \\nsome would be starting (or about to begin your careers), some may be few \\nyears into work life, and others probably halfway through your work life. \\nRegardless of where you are, one of the common goals in life is to ensure that \\nyou retire into a happy and content life. The fact that you have retired should \\nnot stop you from leading a particular desired lifestyle. You should continue \\nto lead a lifestyle that you think you deserve. \\nIf the above is true, then it implies that you need the same amount of \\ndisposable income, as you would have when while you were working. Lesser \\ndisposable income wants a compromised post-retirement lifestyle, which \\nnone of us wants. \\n  \\n  \\nLet us put this in context and assign numbers to it, and elaborate this a bit \\nfurther. \\nAssume you will work for the next 25 years (these are your income-generating \\nyears), post which you will retire. A\\x00er you retire, you expect to live for say 20 \\nmore years. Assume, the cash required today to lead your lifestyle is \\nRs.50,000/- per month. This is cash post taxes, fixed expenses, utility bills, etc. \\nThis is your disposable income per month. \\nThe idea is that a\\x00er 25 years, for the next 20 years of your post-retirement \\nlife, you’ll need the same Rs.50,000/- every month, this is about Rs.600,000/- \\nper year.  \\n  \\n \\nSome of you may disagree or may have a diﬀerent opinion on how much you \\nneed post-retirement; I understand that but stick with for now, please. \\nLet me put this tabular format for you to understand this better –  \\nI’m sure all of you reading would agree that this is a real-life problem and we \\nall need to address this. \\nIf you think about this, there are two parts to this real-life problem – \\nHow much retirement corpus one needs to have accumulated by the time of \\nretirement, i.e. the beginning of the year 2044? \\nHow does one accumulate the required money? \\nSome of you may be tempted to answer the first part straight away – \\n  \\nCurrent year  2019 \\nNumber of working \\nyears  25 \\nYear of retirement  2044 \\nNumber of years \\npost-retirement 20 \\nFinal year  2063 (including \\n2044) \\nMonthly cash \\nrequirement  Rs.50,000/- \\nYearly cash requirement Rs.600,000/- \\n \\nIt is Rs.600,000/- per year (50,000 per month for 12 months) and for 20 year it \\nis Rs.12,000,000/- (600,000 * 20) or 1.2Cr. So if we were to accumulate a \\nretirement corpus of 1.2Cr by the year 2044, we could easily sail through the \\nnext 20 years of post-retirement life by burning Rs.50,000/- per month, all the \\nway to 2063. \\nWell, if only life was that simple J \\nGiven the above, the question is, how much cash reserves you’d need at the \\nend of 25 years, i.e. in the year 2044, such that you can have Rs.50,000/- every \\nmonth till the year 2064. \\nIn this chapter, we will address the required corpus bit and figure out the \\namount needed at the start of the retirement year. In the next section, we will figure out how this corpus gets generated. \\n4.2 – Inflation and other realities of life \\nIn the absence of inflation, the math above would work like a charm, i.e. in \\nthe year 2044, a sum of Rs.12,000,000/- would help us sail through our \\nretirement years at ease, i.e. at the rate of Rs.50,000/- per month up to 2064. \\nHowever, inflation is real, and this makes life complicated in multiple ways. \\nInflation is the phenomenon, which makes things expensive. For example, a \\nplate of pav bhaji at a restaurant may cost Rs.50/- today, but the same may \\ncost Rs.55/- at the very same restaurant the next year. This marginal increase \\nin cost is attributed to inflation. In other words, the purchasing power of \\nmoney has reduced over one year. \\n  \\n \\nThis is true, all else equal, money today will always be less valuable at a \\nfuture date. For this same reason, all the stories of our parents and \\ngrandparents enjoying a full meal for less than Rs.2/- exists J \\nThis implies, today’s Rs.50,000/- will not be Rs.50,000/- tomorrow. It will \\nnaturally reduce owing to inflation. For this exact reason, we cannot only \\nmultiply the amount required with the number of years and arrive at a figure. \\n4.3 – The Future value \\nTo find a solution, we need to find out the Rs.50,000/- equivalent 25 years \\nfrom now. This is what we learned in the previous chapter. \\nThe expected cash requirement is as shown below – \\n  \\nYear of \\nretirement \\nYear \\nHow many \\nyears away \\nCorpus required as per \\ntoday’s value \\n01  2044  25  Rs.600,000/- \\n02  2045  26  Rs.600,000/- \\n03  2046  27  Rs.600,000/- \\n04  2047  28  Rs.600,000/- \\n05  2048  29  Rs.600,000/- \\n06  2049  30  Rs.600,000/- \\n07  2050  31  Rs.600,000/- \\n08  2051  32  Rs.600,000/- \\n  \\nThe table is quite easy to understand. Look at the first row, it says, the 1 st \\nretirement year is 2044, and it is 25 years from the current year i.e.2019. The \\ncorpus required for 2044 is Rs.600,000/-. This is a constant amount needed for \\nall the retirement years. \\nThe 2nd retirement year is 2045, which is 26 years away from the current year \\n(2019). So on and so forth. \\n  \\n09  2052  33  Rs.600,000/- \\n10  2053  34  Rs.600,000/- \\n11  2054  36  Rs.600,000/- \\n12  2055  37  Rs.600,000/- \\n13  2056  38  Rs.600,000/- \\n14  2057   Rs.600,000/- \\n15  2058  40  Rs.600,000/- \\n16  2059  41  Rs.600,000/- \\n17  2060  42  Rs.600,000/- \\n18  2061  43  Rs.600,000/- \\n19  2062  44  Rs.600,000/- \\n20  2063  45  Rs.600,000/- \\n \\nNow the task at hand is to estimate the value of Rs.600,000/- 25 years later, 26 \\nyears later, 27 years later, and for each year up to the final year, given a certain \\nlevel of inflation. Remember, these are all the future value of money. \\n4.4 – Estimating the future value of the corpus \\nTo proceed further from this point and estimate the corpus required at the \\nstart of the retirement year, i.e. 2044, we need to have a view on the long-term \\ninflation. \\nI would be comfortable pegging the long-term average inflation value \\nbetween 4-5%. Now, the question to answer is – given 5% inflation, what \\nwould be the value of Rs.600,000/- 25 years from now. \\nSimilarly, given 5% inflation, what would be the value of Rs.600,000/-, 26 \\nyears from now, so on and so forth, all the way to the 20 years of retirement. \\nIf you recollect from the previous chapter, we are talking about the future \\nvalue calculation here. Once we have all the future values, we need to sum \\nthem up to get the total corpus required at the start of the retirement year. \\nLet us do this for the initial 2-3 years and then take the help of MS Excel to \\nfigure the rest. \\nFrom the previous chapter, the future value formula is – \\nFuture value =   P*(1+R)^(n) \\nWhere, \\nP= Principal i.e. Rs.600,000/- \\nR = opportunity cost, in this context it is the inflation rate, so 5% \\n  \\n \\nn = Period, 25 in this case \\nPlugging in these value – \\n600,000*(1+5%)^(25) \\n= Rs.2,031,813/- \\nSo, in 25 years, if you have Rs.2,031,813/-, then it is as good as having \\nRs.600,000/- today. \\nFor the 2 nd  year – \\n600,000*(1+5%)^(26) \\n= Rs.2,133,404/- \\nSo, in 26 years, if you have Rs.2,133,404/-, then it is as good as having \\nRs.600,000/- today. \\nSo on and so forth. \\nHere is an excel snapshot that shows how the numbers stack up for all the \\nother years, but before you look at it, can you guess how much this amount \\ncan be? \\nFor most people I’ve asked this question, they get the value way oﬀ the mark, \\nthis is because they cannot comprehend the fact there is inflation and \\ncompounding (future value) at play here. \\nSo go ahead and give it a shot, take a guess on how much the retirement \\ncorpus should be, once you’ve answered this, then take a look at the actual \\nnumber; hopefully, it should match, if not, don’t worry, we all have some \\nlearning to do. \\n  \\n  \\nAs you can see, the corpus required at the start of the retirement year is a \\nstaggering 7.2Crs! \\nThe numbers drastically change if we change the inflation assumption and of \\ncourse the actual amount of our lifestyle demands. \\n4.5 – Oversimplification \\nSome of the things are oversimplified and exaggerated here. For instance, \\nhaving a constant monthly requirement of 50k may not be accurate. As we \\nage, we would prefer to sit at home and sip a drink as opposed to hanging out \\nin the coolest and trendiest bar in town. Or we may cut down on all the \\noutside eating, watching movies, etc. We may not want to buy the latest \\ndenim from levis or the newest pair of sneakers from Nike. Who knows? \\n  \\n \\nOur requirements could be very diﬀerent, and from whatever I’ve read, \\nobserved, and understood, the money required for older people is lesser than \\nthe younger ones. So we may not need 50K per month when we retire. \\nBut here is the thing with personal finance, it is best to take a conservative \\napproach and figure out the outcome. If we manage to lead a comfortable but \\nyet a frugal life at a later point, its great, else we would have anyway \\nbudgeted for it. \\nIn the next chapter, we will understand ways to generate this income. \\nDownload  the excel sheet used in this chapter here. \\nKey takeaways from this chapter \\n● Retirement is a real-life financial problem that we all need to \\naddress ● Inflation complicates things. Money today is not the same \\ntomorrow \\n● The inflation diminishes the purchasing power of money \\n● Use the future value of money to estimate the worth of money \\ntoday, ‘n’, many years later.      \\n  \\n \\nCHAPTER  5 \\nThe retirement problem (Part 2)  \\n5.1 – Assumptions \\nWe are at an exciting point now. The previous chapter helped us estimate \\n(roughly) the corpus required for one to retire comfortably, without \\ndrastically changing the post-retirement lifestyle. \\nOne can argue that certain aspects were overlooked while estimating the \\npost-retirement corpus, which is ok for now because this helps us determine \\nthe retirement corpus on a conservative basis. \\nThe idea, of course, is to understand personal finance so well that we can \\nplugin things as we progress and eventually get the corpus number right. \\nIn the previous chapter, we figured that we need roughly 7Cr by retirement; in \\nthis chapter, we address the technique to generate the same. It must be quite \\nevident to you by now that to create the retirement corpus by the target \\nretirement year; we need to make investments starting today. \\nThe investments that we make today should ideally spread across multiple \\nassets. This is called the multi-asset portfolio, which includes – fixed deposits, \\ngold, real estate, equities, cash, and cash equivalents. The overall growth that \\nyou experience will then be an aggregate across all these assets. \\n  \\n\\n  \\nLet me explain a bit more before we get back to the retirement problem. \\nAssume your net worth is distributed across multiple assets – \\n30% of your net worth is invested in real estate \\n8% of your net worth is in the fixed deposit \\n8% of your net worth is from gold \\n13% of your net worth is in equities \\nCash is 4% \\nThe numbers assigned are all arbitrary, to drive the concept, so don’t sweat \\nover it 🙂 Now, each of these assets grows at a specific rate. Needless to say that the \\ngrowth rates diﬀer for each of these assets. The question is, what is the \\noverall growth given this portfolio of assets? \\nTo answer this, we need to have an expected growth rate for each of these \\nassets. \\n  \\n \\nMy long term (10 plus years) growth expectation (CAGR) from these assets are as follows – \\nReal estate – 8-10% \\nFixed Deposit – 6-7% \\nGold – 8-9% \\nEquities – 10-11% \\nCash – 0% (in fact cash de grows if you consider inflation) \\nYou can develop your own opinion on the growth rates for these assets by \\nlooking at the long-term trends and by developing an idea on their future \\nperformance. But here is an advise, when you work with \\npredictions/projections of any sort in personal finance, always keep the \\nnumber on a conservative basis. \\nFor example, frankly, I know equities, in the long run, will do much better \\nthan 11% CAGR, but I’ll work with a 10-11% range. The advantage here is that \\nyou build a future based on conservative assumption, anything better is only \\na bonus. \\nAnyway, the overall portfolio growth in the sum product of the weight of each \\nasset and the expected return. Therefore – \\n= 30% * 10% + 8% * 7% + 8% * 9% + 13% * 11% + 4%* 0 \\n=  8.3% \\nSo as you can see, the combined (diversified) portfolio with multi-assets, \\ngenerates an overall return of 8.3%. \\n  \\n \\nOf course, change in asset allocation has an impact on portfolio growth. We \\nhave discussed this multiple times, won’t get into that discussion now. \\nBy the way, check this to know how people generally divide their net worth \\nacross a diverse set of assets –  \\nThe infographic above mainly talks about the HNI and above category; \\nhowever, if you walk into any financial planning firm, you are likely to get a \\nsomewhat similar diversification plan. \\n  \\n \\nWhile a multi-asset portfolio is highly desirable, we won’t get into that \\ndiscussion just yet. This is slightly complex, and we are too early in this \\nmodule to talk about it. \\nFor the retirement problem, we will make one fundamental assumption. The \\nassumption is that we will look at only equity for building the retirement \\ncorpus. The exposure to equity is in the form of making systematic \\ninvestments in a growth-oriented equity mutual fund. \\nIf you do not understand ‘systematic investments in a growth-oriented equity mutual fund’, then do not worry. Going forward in this module, we will \\ndiscuss this in detail. \\nSince equity is the only asset we are dealing with in this retirement problem, \\nwe need to assign an expected growth rate to this asset. I think a 10-11% \\nCARG is a fair expectation, especially when the holding period is long, i.e. \\nmore than ten plus years. \\nSo let’s work with this number for now. \\n5.2 – The setup \\nA quick recap of the retirement problem, before we proceed. In the previous \\nchapter, we figured that we need funds to the tune of 7Crs to lead a \\ncomfortable retired life. We call this a retirement corpus. We defied \\n‘comfortable’ by ensuring we have at least Rs.50,000/- per month for the 20 \\nyears post-retirement. \\nThe next step is to figure out how one can generate a retirement corpus. \\nRemember, we are starting our journey to save for retirement today, and we \\nhave 25 years to build this corpus. Twenty-five years is 300 months. \\n  \\n \\nFor now, we will rely upon investing in an equity mutual fund, in a systematic \\nway to generate this retirement corpus. To solve this problem, we need to \\nmake a few assumptions. They are – \\nWe have a steady job which pays us a salary every month \\nWe are employed until the year of our retirement \\nOur primary savings vehicle is regular investments in equity mutual funds \\nWe get yearly hikes in our pay \\nEvery year we will increase the investments in equity mutual funds by 10% \\nThe increase in savings happens every January \\nI know many of you may be concerned with these assumptions here, \\nespecially about the job and the hikes, but then, that’s an underlying \\nassumption, without which we cannot proceed 🙂 \\nSo how do these assumptions translate to action? Here is how it looks –  \\nLet me explain this table. The very first row reads like this – \\n  \\n \\nIt is January, and I’m making my very first investment of Rs.00/- today. I \\nwon’t be touching this investment until I retire, which is 25 years away or \\nabout 300 months away. \\nThe 2 nd  row reads similar – Its February, I’m making the 2 nd  savings \\ninstallment for the year, i.e. Rs.00/-. Retirement is now 299 months away. \\nI want you to recognize the fact that the ‘months away’ can be looked at from \\na diﬀerent perspective. If you realize, these are the number of months during \\nwhich your money can grow. For example, the very first installment you make \\nhas the luxury to build (or compound) for 300 full months. The next month’s \\nsavings can grow only for 299 months, 3 rd  installment has only 298 months to \\ngrow. So on and so forth. \\nNow, the 5 th  and 6 th  assumptions state that we are increasing the savings rate \\nby 10% every January. This means, if we are starting with Rs.00/- for year 1, \\nthe 2 nd  year we bump this up by 10%, hence for the 2 nd  year we invest \\nRs.5,0/-. \\nThis is how it looks – \\n  \\n  \\nThe month counting continues the same way. For example, the Rs.5,500/- investment we make in the 2 nd  year January has only 288 months to grow or \\ncompound. \\nI hope you get this flow for now. \\nSo what happens a\\x00er you make these investments? Well, as per the \\nassumption, each of these monthly investments we make, grows at 11% \\nCAGR (compounded annual growth rate), for the respective months. \\n  \\n \\nFor example, the very first investment that we make, i.e. Rs.5000/- gets to \\ngrow at the rate of 11%, for 300 months. So what would be the value of this \\ninvestment at the end of 300 months? \\nWell, by now, you should recognize that we can apply the concept of the \\nfuture value of money and get the answer. The future value of money formula \\nis – \\nFuture value =   P*(1+R)^(n) \\nWhere, \\nPrincipal ( P ) = Rs.5000 \\nGrowth rate ( R ) = 11% per annum \\nTime ( n ) = 300 months. However, this formula considers time in years. Hence \\nwe need to express 300 months in years, therefore 300/12 = 25 \\n= 5000*(1+11%)^(300/12) \\n=Rs.67,927/- \\nLet us do this for the 2 nd  installment as well; everything stays the same except \\nfor the time component – \\n= 5000*(1+11%)^(299/12) \\n= Rs.67,339/- \\nThis is how the table looks – \\n  \\n  \\nNow, if you add up all the future values, you get the corpus accumulated for \\nyour retirement. Before I show you the number, what is your guess? Does \\nRs.5000/- as the starting amount make the cut? Do you think it gives you the \\ntarget corpus of Rs.7Crs? \\nIf you are doubtful, then you are right. It does not cut the mark. It’s way oﬀ \\nthe mark –   \\n  \\n \\nSo what should we do? How do we ensure we reach the target retirement \\ncorpus? Well, we can do three things – \\nWe save for a much longer period, say 30 or 35 years. However, this may not \\nbe viable as we won’t have a sustainable source of income for these many \\nyears \\nIncrease the rate of return, maybe from 11% to 14%, but then is like robbing \\nyourself of your future. So we won’t commit this sin \\nIncrease savings, this means a frugal life today for a comfortable and \\nfinancially independent life tomorrow. This is an option we can work with \\nthis. \\nSo from saving Rs.5000 per month, let us bump this up to say Rs.15,000/- per \\nmonth. Here is how the numbers stack up –  \\nThere is a significant improvement, but still not close to the 7Cr mark. We can \\ntry this with Rs.20,000/- \\n  \\n  \\nAs you can see, starting at Rs.20,000/- per month, we get close to the 7 Cr \\nmark, which upon retirement will yield us Rs.50,000/- per month for 20 years. \\n5.3 – Are you serious? \\nSaving Rs.20,000/- a month, that too as a starting amount may sound crazy to \\nmany, especially for people who are just starting their careers. A\\x00er all, \\nyou’ve just started your career, started seeing a steady cash flow, and you are \\nexpected to park the bulk of it for retirement? \\nHow fair is that? \\nBefore it demotivates you any further, let me tell you. It is not all that lousy \\n🙂 Let me make an assumption here; if you are starting your career now, then \\nprobably you are 24 or 25 years old. This means you have a long runway \\nbefore you retire. Even if you retire by 60, you mostly have 35 years to retire. \\nOut of these 35 years of service, even if you invest for 30 years, you will be \\nplaced much better. You can choose to start with Rs.10,000/- per month. \\nCheck the snapshot – \\n  \\n  \\nStarting your career early, gives you two powerful levers to operate – time \\nand money. You can start with a small amount and build on it, eventually, it \\nwill yield you a similar result. \\nWhat if you are in the middle of your career and you are looking at retirement \\nsometime over the next 10 or 15 years? Well, unfortunately, you do not have \\nmany options expect to save large chunks of your cash flow. \\nBut remember, this entire conversation is an oversimplification to help us get \\nstarted. There are many angles to this story. For example, you may acquire \\nproperty by inheritance, which earns you a rental income for the rest of your \\nlife or you can get a huge lump sum amount at retirement, thanks to PF and \\nstuﬀ. This retirement amount gets parked in a savings account or a fixed \\ndeposit, which gives you yearly cash flow. \\nThe objective of this module is to help you solve this puzzle so that you can \\nplan your financials eﬀiciently for yourself and your family. 5.4 –Next step \\nIrrespective of the lump sum cash or a yielding rental property landing up in \\nyour lap by retirement, investing in equity is something that you cannot miss. \\n  \\n \\nI firmly believe that ‘equity’ as an asset class will outperform all other assets \\nand shine through. Equity has to be a part of your long term portfolio. \\nThe best way to gain exposure to equity is by investing in mutual funds via a \\nsystematic investment plan. Of course, there are many other variants and \\ntechniques for this. \\nGiven this, over the next few chapters, we will deep dive into mutual funds \\nand get a thorough understanding of mutual fund investing. This discussion \\nwill include things like developing a mindset for mutual fund investment, \\nbuilding a mutual fund portfolio, goal-based portfolio, fund analysis, direct vs \\nregular, growth vs dividends, etc. \\nOnce we understand mutual funds, we will steer our way to learn other \\ncritical components of personal finance such as life insurance, health \\ninsurance, pension funds, EPF, ETFs etc. \\nSo as you can imagine, we have a long learning path ahead 🙂 Key takeaways from this chapter \\n● In a multi-asset portfolio, the aggregate portfolio return is the \\nsum product of the asset weight and the asset’s expected \\nreturns \\n● Equity exposure is a critical component in long term wealth \\ncreation \\n● Investing small amounts of money regularly leads to a massive \\nretirement corpus \\n  \\n \\nCHAPTER  6 \\nIntroduction to Mutual Funds  \\n6.1 – Flashback \\nThe retirement problem chapter has laid down a learning path to understand \\npersonal finance. We know now that to build a retirement corpus, long-term \\ninvestments in mutual funds is inevitable. Given the pivotal role mutual funds \\nplays in defining our financial welfare, it is completely justified to spend some \\ntime to learn about mutual funds. The learning that I’m talking about is \\nsomething that goes beyond normal mutual fund investors would know. The \\nobjective here is to help you know the basics plus a little more. Hence, the \\ntopics I’d like to cover here are – \\nWhat is a mutual fund? \\nWho runs a mutual fund and why? \\nRegulatory aspects around a mutual fund from an MF investor’s perspective \\nThe diﬀerent types of mutual funds – Equity, Debt, FoF, Hybrid, Liquid \\nHow to analyze a mutual fund? – Risk, return, ratios, exposure \\nFactors that matter – MF ranking, Direct vs Regular, Growth vs Dividend \\nSetting long term return and risk expectations \\nConstructing goal-based mutual fund portfolios \\nLogistics – SIP, SWP, STP, CAS statements, DEMAT vs non-DEMAT mode \\nTracking investments \\nMutual fund taxation \\n  \\n\\n \\nOf course, I will add more topics if there is a need for it. \\nGiven this, let us get started on the very first topic i.e. to understand what a \\n“mutual fund” really means. \\nI’m making an assumption here that you know nothing about mutual funds. \\nI’m assuming that this is your very first attempt to learn about mutual funds, \\nhence we are starting from scratch. You can skip this chapter if you know \\nwhat a mutual fund is. \\nBefore we start learning about Mutual funds, I’d like to digress a bit and \\nnarrate a personal story dating back to 2008-09. \\nI’m not sure how many of you reading this were trading, investing, tracking or \\nremotely connected to the stock markets in the year 2008. The year 2008 was \\nvery interesting (perhaps scary) for people sitting on the sidelines and \\nwatching all the action, but for people involved and had their livelihoods tied \\nto the market, 2008 was apocalyptic. The financial services industry was in \\nabsolute pits, and I was in the city of London, which was the epicentre of the \\nfinancial meltdown. I was relatively new in the industry, had very few industry \\nconnections, and hardly any working experience in the UK. When the \\nindustry-wide job cuts started, I knew it would be me sooner or later. The \\ngood thing was I just dint sit on the sideline wondering if I would get the \\nlayoﬀ notice. I knew it was a matter of time. \\nGiven the situation, I had decided to head back to India. Of course, not that \\nthere many options for me to choose. \\nBy Feb 2009, I was back in Bangalore, luckily I found myself a spot to sit and \\ntrade the markets with the (now) legendary Kamath Associates (pre-Zerodha \\n  \\n \\ndays). Soon, I was in the thick of the action and I was trading anything and \\neverything that moved on the Indian exchanges. \\nThe capital to trade was mainly my own plus a bit from my close circle. \\nWhile trading was something I enjoyed, I found investing super interesting. I \\nspent a lot of time reading the annual reports and understanding of \\nbusinesses. This eﬀort included learning a bit of accounting to help me read \\nthe company’s financial statements. I soon realized that stock picking and \\nbuilding long-term equity portfolio was something that I wanted to for a \\nliving. \\nI slowly branched out from active trading and started building an investing \\npractice. I moved out of Kamath Associates to do this full time. Of course, at \\nthat point, Kamath Associates dissolved and Nithin Kamath started Zerodha. \\nOver time I built a carefully cra\\x00ed equity portfolio for myself. I had a thesis \\nfor each investment made. I was aware of the growth drivers and the risk \\nparameters for each stock I had invested. \\nWhile I started doing this for myself, I soon extended my help in setting up an \\nequity portfolio for my family members and later to my close friends. I had \\nfew things going right for me and soon people around me and their \\nimmediate circle knew I was a good option to consider for equity investing. It \\nwas in November 2010, that I decided to do this as a profession. \\nMy idea was to help people build an equity portfolio, manage it on their \\nbehalf, grow it, review it periodically, assess the risk, and do everything \\npossible with a single point agenda – to help them generate wealth over a \\nlong period. \\n  \\n \\nIn short, I wanted to be a ‘Fund Manager’, help people build wealth by investing their money in the stock market. \\nI continued my journey, by 2012, I was fortunate enough to onboard a bunch \\nof clients and managed a decent sum of money. I was taking an independent \\ndecision on which stock to invest in and which stocks to exit. I was deciding how much to invest in each stock and for how long. On the first Saturday of \\nevery month, I’d send a report to all my clients informing them of how their \\nportfolio was performing in the market. \\nI was indeed a fund manager for at least 20-25 families, and I felt happy and \\nresponsible being in that position.  \\nHowever, there was a problem lurking. As per the regulators, i.e. SEBI, anyone \\naspiring to be a fund manager and manage portfolios, had to procure a \\nlicense from SEBI. This license is called the ‘Portfolio Management Service’ \\n(PMS) license. Probably I’ll discuss PMS later in the module. Given my \\nsituation, the cost of applying for this license and the associated net worth \\n  \\n \\nrequirements was prohibitive. Hence, I was forced to shut shop in the \\nsubsequent years and return the investment capital to the clients. \\nAnyway, thanks for reading through my rather boring flashback, but I had a \\nreason to share this with you. I want you to identify a few things. As a \\nself-proclaimed fund manager, I was trying to – \\n1. Researching stocks \\n2. Build an investment thesis for each stock \\n3. Estimate the amount of money to invest in each stock \\n4. Build an equity portfolio \\n5. Track individual stock and overall portfolio \\n6. Measure the returns, performance, and risk at periodical intervals \\n7. Report to clients \\nThe points mentioned above captures the role of a typical fund manager. At \\nthis point, I want you to be very clear about the role of a fund manager. \\nAlso, a quick reminder – we are in the process of understanding what ‘mutual \\nfunds’, means and I hope I’m heading in the right direction, so please do stay \\nwith me on this 🙂 6.2 – Large scale fund manager \\nI guess most of us at some point would have paid a visit to the neighborhood \\nbakery to buy either a loaf of bread or a pack of biscuit baked by the baker. \\nThese biscuits usually have a local and unique taste to it, not available \\nelsewhere in the city. It is a local thing. It is nearly impossible for a person in \\nanother city to source the same biscuit. \\n  \\n \\nHowever, think of the biscuits made by Britannia, a large-scale biscuit and \\ncookie manufacturer. It does not matter whether I’m in Bangalore or Delhi. \\nThe same Britannia biscuit is available throughout the country. It tastes the \\nsame, has the same packaging, looks identical, and weighs the same. Not a \\ngrain of salt or sugar varies from one pack to another. It is a highly \\nstandardized oﬀering. \\nBritannia is a large-scale baker, with a distribution network across the \\ncountry. The baker in your neighborhood is a local baker, with the residents \\nas his loyal customers. He does not have a distribution network like Britannia. \\nNow think about my ‘fund management’ aﬀair, I guess you would agree that I \\nwas comparable to the local baker, catering to a small set of customers in the \\nneighborhood. \\nOn similar lines, there are “fund managers”, on a large-scale basis who can \\ncater to millions of customers and oﬀer the same service to each one of these \\ncustomers. \\nCustomers in the fund management context are people who are looking for \\n‘fund management’, services. \\nThese large-scale fund managers typically operate via a mutual fund structure. Think of the mutual fund structure as a method to oﬀer fund \\nmanagement at scale. I will shortly discuss this in more detail, but before \\nthat, let us draw a quick analogy to reestablish the things we have learned so \\nfar – \\n  \\n  \\nAt this point, all I want you to understand is this – \\n1. A fund manager is responsible for your funds \\n2. An Asset Management Company (AMC), is a company where a fund \\nmanager works and manages your money \\n3. Think of the ‘Mutual Fund structure’, as a vehicle or mechanism to \\nmanage your funds \\nI hope so far so good. We will now proceed to understand how a mutual fund \\ncompany is structured and functions. I understand that you do not need to \\nknow about this, as long as you know how to invest in a mutual fund. Fair \\nenough, but I have a slightly diﬀerent objective here i.e. to make you a little \\nmore knowledgeable than a normal MF investor. \\nIt is like this, you can buy a DSLR camera, turn on the auto mode and start \\nclicking the pictures. Chances are you will end up taking decent pictures. \\nHowever, if you take the eﬀort of knowing a little more about your camera, \\nyou may end up using your camera more eﬀiciently, which may perhaps \\nresult in a brilliant photograph. \\nTherefore, in my opinion, knowing a bit about the structure of an AMC will not \\ngo waste. It is one of those ‘good to know’, things in life 🙂     \\n \\n6.3 – Deconstructing an AMC \\nSetting up an Asset Management Company (AMC) is a very daunting task. You \\ncannot wake up one day and decide to start an AMC. There are prerequisites \\nto set up an AMC and these prerequisites are laid down by ‘The Securities and \\nExchange Board of India’ (SEBI). SEBI is the governing authority for all the \\nAMCs in India. SEBI holds the rights to grant or not grant the AMC license to a \\ncorporate body. \\nThe process of setting up and AMC is highly stringent and rightfully so. A\\x00er \\nall, there is a large scale public money at stake and the regulators need to \\nensure this money is managed by responsible entities. \\nIn their eﬀort to bring in transparency and accountability, SEBI has proposed \\na multi-tier structure for an AMC. Here is the structure of an AMC –  \\nFund sponsor  – Think of the fund sponsor as the main promoter of the Asset \\nManagement Company. The fund sponsor is a corporate body, which \\n  \\n \\nexpresses a desire to set up an AMC. The fund sponsor approaches SEBI for \\nsetting up the AMC. The fund sponsor has to follow the 2 stage application \\nprocess by furnishing all the details SEBI would require. At the end of stage 1, \\nSEBI either denies the licenses or grants an ‘in principle’, approval for the same. \\nOnce the in-principal approval is issued, SEBI demands more documents and \\ndetails for further scrutiny. Finally, a\\x00er the stringent due diligence process, \\nSEBI can again decide to either grant or deny the AMC license to the fund \\nsponsor. \\nTrustees –  Once the fund sponsor procures the license from SEBI, they need \\nto register a trust and appoint a board of trustees. The trust ensures that the \\nAMC formed by the fund sponsor carries out its duties in the right spirit and \\nworks in the interest of the clients of the AMC (unit holders). SEBI also \\nmandates that the trustee of the fund is independent and not associated with \\nthe sponsor in any way. \\nAMC –  The trust in consultation with the fund sponsor appoints an AMC. The \\nAMC is also called the ‘Investment Manager’. The role of the AMC is to float a \\nmutual fund and manage the diﬀerent investment schemes of the AMC. The \\nAMC houses a chief investment oﬀicer (CIO), fund managers, analysts, and \\neveryone responds to run and manage the mutual fund. The AMC is \\nresponsible for the operation and management of diﬀerent mutual fund \\nschemes, in compliance with the SEBI’s rules and regulations. \\nThink of the AMC as the core engine responsible for running the mutual fund \\nshow. \\n  \\n \\nCustodian –  The AMC now appoints a custodian. A custodian’s job is to hold \\nall the shares that the mutual fund buys. Think of the custodian as the safe \\nkeepers or the guardians of the mutual fund assets. \\nRTA –  The ‘Registrar and Transfer Agents’ is appointed by the AMC. The RTA’s \\njob is to ensure that they serve the clients of a mutual fund (unit holders). The \\nservices here include issuing folio numbers, transfer of unit, etc. \\nThe custodian and the RTA are called the ‘service provider’, for the AMC \\ncompany. \\nAll the parties involved work in synch to run the mutual fund company. For \\nyou as an investor, the only two things that matter is – \\nWho is the sponsor of the AMC, this is to ensure you are dealing with credible \\nnames \\nWho the fund manager is – to ensure the money is handled by the right \\nperson \\nAnyway, let us put all of this information in context before we wrap this \\nchapter. \\n  \\n  \\nAs you can see, these details belong to the Aditya Birla AMC. \\nThere are two sponsors here i.e. Aditya Birla Capital Limited and Sun Life \\n(India) AMC Investments Inc. These two companies have jointly approached \\nSEBI to procure an AMC license. Since there are two fund sponsors, this is a \\njoint venture and the shareholding is as follows –  \\nThe sponsors, a\\x00er obtaining the AMC license have floated Aditya Birla Sun \\nLife AMC Limited, which is the name of the investment manager or AMC. \\nThey have also formed a Trustee company called, the Aditya Birla Sun Life \\nTrustee Private Limited. \\nThe details of the service provider are as follows – \\n  \\n  \\nAs you can see, the company as appointed, two custodians (Citi and \\nDeutsche) and 1 RTA (CAMS). Besides, there are other details on the bankers \\nand auditors.    \\n  \\n \\nKey takeaways from this chapter – \\n● A fund manager is responsible for managing the mutual fund \\n● The sponsor of the AMC is like the promoter of a mutual fund \\n● The sponsor holds the AMC license \\n● The sponsors appoint a trustee and AMC company \\n● AMC is the investment manager responsible for running the \\nmutual fund \\n● Custodian appointed by the AMC is responsible for holding \\nshares and other assets of the AMC \\n● The RTA is responsible for servicing the AMC’s unitholders              \\n  \\n \\nCHAPTER  7 \\nConcept of fund & NAV  \\n7.1 – The Family pot \\nI hope the previous chapter helped you understand the structure of a Mutual \\nFund company. Although not essential, I believe that the understanding of \\nthe Mutual fund structure will help you at some point in your investment \\njourney. \\nMoving ahead, we direct our eﬀorts to learn more about Mutual fund \\ninvesting. We will learn about the diﬀerent fund category, fund analysis, fund \\nschemes, and many other things associated with mutual fund investment. \\nNow, before we learn these concepts, we need to understand a fundamental \\nconcept. From my observation, I’ve noticed that many people get a bit lost \\nwhen we use the term ‘fund’ in the context of a mutual fund. \\nSo before we start digging deeper into the mutual fund concepts, we must get \\ncomplete clarity on what the term ‘fund’ means. \\nI will take the liberty to simplify many things in this chapter; the \\nsimplifications in this chapter are only to help you get the context right. \\nSo let us started, and as usual, let us build an imaginary story to help relate to \\nthe topic better. \\nNow, think of yourself as the stock market whiz-kid in your family. You have \\nmade a few successful stock investments, managed to score few \\n  \\n\\n \\nmulti-bagger, called the market top and bottom couple of times, and have \\neven managed to get a selfie with Rakesh Junjunwala at an event. \\nThe story of your stock market success has sent a ripple in your family circuit, \\nand you are even the centre of attention in the family WhatsApp group. \\nAs expected, soon, your uncles, aunts, and cousins approach you to help \\nthem manage their money. The quasi fund manager status that you have \\nachieved for yourself has gotten you all excited. \\nThe question is – how will you manage this money? \\nGoing strictly by regulations, unless you hold the license for fund \\nmanagement, like the PMS license we discussed in the previous chapter, you \\ncannot manage other people’s money. \\nGiven this, assume that you apply for a fund management license and \\neventually procure one from SEBI. \\nNow, you are all set to render your fund management services to your family \\nmembers and hopefully soon to many others outside the family. \\nYour family members are happy and are eager to reap the benefits of your \\nfund management skills. The following family members approach you with \\ntheir money. The details follow –  \\n  \\n \\nSo you have five individual investors and each one of them has a diﬀerent \\namount of money to invest. In total, across these five individuals, you have \\nmanaged to pool in Rs.275,000/-.  \\nBefore you get started, you need to set a few expectations – \\nAll investors are treated fairly in terms of return generated \\nYou are permitted to treat these individuals diﬀer in terms of service \\nprovided. For example, the aunt has invested the highest amount, so maybe \\nwhen she visits, you can give her coﬀees and cookies, while the nephew has \\ninvested the least, so you can decide not to oﬀer the coﬀee and cookies  \\nThe above two are critical points, let us spend a bit more time to rivet it. \\nImagine you and I walk into a restaurant. You are a regular at the restaurant \\nhave been to the restaurant multiple times and have generated enough \\nbusiness for the restaurant. However, this is my first visit to the restaurant. \\nWe both end up ordering a portion of biryani. The quality and quantity of the \\nbiryani we both get served will remain the same. However, since you are \\n  \\n \\nregular, the owner himself may decide to serve you with fine silver cutlery, \\nand the owner may even spend a few minutes chatting about your \\nwell-being. On the other hand, I’d be served with regular cutlery and treated \\nlike a regular customer. \\nHowever we both get to eat the same dish, no diﬀerence there. \\nSo you as a fund manager can diﬀerentiate between customers on how much \\nthey have invested, but should certainly not diﬀerentiate and generate two \\ndiﬀerent returns for two diﬀerent customers based on how much they have \\ninvested. They all should experience the same returns. In fact, in the mutual fund world, this gets further streamlined in terms of \\ninvestment objectives, mandates, and other things. We will get to that in the \\nnext chapter. \\nAnyway, now that the expectations are in place, it now boils down to logistic \\narrangements on how this money gets managed. \\nTo manage this money, you now ask your family members to transfer all the \\nmoney into one single account. The idea is to pool all the money in the same \\naccount and use that to make investments in the market. \\nSince it’s all pooled into one account, that account holding the funds belongs \\nto all. Think of this as a rationale as to why ‘Mutual funds’ are called ‘Mutual’ \\nFunds. \\n7.2 – The fund logistics \\nAs a fund manager, it is your responsibility to ensure that those funds are \\ninvested in the stock market, and it grows at a healthy rate. The selection of \\n  \\n \\nstocks is your prerogative, and you get to pick the stocks, choose for how long \\nto hold them and decide when to sell them. While you do this, you need to \\nensure that every investor of yours is given the same treatment in terms of \\nwealth creation. \\nRemember, you are pooling all individual monies and investing it as a whole \\naka a fund. So the return experienced by the investors should be uniform. \\nSo given this, how do we ensure we have an equitable distribution of returns \\nacross all the clients? \\nTo do this, we can start by issuing shares against the investment made by \\neach investor. We can start by assigning a notional value to each of these \\nshares. \\nThis notional value or the initial value can be anything, and you can assign \\n5,10,50, or even 100 as the starting value. It does not matter. The most \\npopular notional value if Rs.10, so we will stick to that. \\nWe now issue Rs.10/- notional value shares to all our investors and estimate \\nthe number of shares each investor holds. For example, the uncle has \\ninvested Rs.65,000/-, so he gets – \\n= 65,000/10 \\n= 6500 shares. \\nThe table now looks like this – \\n  \\n  \\nThe total number of shares distributed across the five investors is 27,500, \\nwhich, when multiplied by the notional value, i.e. 10, gives us the total corpus \\nvalue, i.e. Rs.275,000/-. \\nAlright, now that the fund is formed and shares distributed across clients, the \\nfund manager gets to work on things he is best at, i.e. to pick stocks and \\ninvest the money. \\nAs a fund manager, you decide to invest the funds, i.e. Rs.275,000/- across ten \\nstocks. For the sake of simplicity, you choose to invest the same amount \\nacross all the ten stocks. The distribution of funds in this manner is referred \\nto as the ‘equally distributed portfolio’. \\nThe total corpus is Rs.275,000/-, so each stock gets an investment of \\nRs.27,500/-. \\nThe division of funds across the ten diﬀerent stocks look like this –  \\n  \\n \\nAs you can see, the money invested across ten diﬀerent stocks, each with \\ndiﬀerent share price, but the same investment goes to every stock, i.e. \\nRs.27,500/- \\nAt this stage, two things are in place – \\nThe shares are issued to all investors. The number of shares is proportional to \\nthe individual investment made \\nThe funds are invested in the markets across ten diﬀerent stocks \\nNow, once the funds are entirely invested in the market, the value of the \\noverall fund depends on how the shares perform daily. A few stocks can go \\nup, and a few can come down, resulting in either a profit or a loss. This profit \\nand loss should be passed to the investors. The quantum of profit or loss \\nexperienced by the investors is directly dependent on the amount of money \\neach investor has invested in the fund. \\nLet’s continue the example to see how the P&L pass through happens. I’ve \\nrandomly assigned percentage movement to all these stocks.  \\nAs you can see, the stock prices have changed on day 2, thereby the invested \\nvalue across each share also varies accordingly. As a result of this change, the \\n  \\n \\ntotal value of the portfolio is Rs.277,844. The fund has generated a one day \\nreturn of Rs.2,844/- or 1.0340%. \\nThe profit of Rs.2,844/- has to be distributed across all the five investors in \\nproportion to their investments. To ensure a fair distribution, all we need to \\ndo is, ensure the notional value goes up (or down) by the same percentage as \\nthe fund, which is 1.0340% in this case. \\nInitial notional value (day 1) – 10 \\nP&L % in funds – 1.0340% \\nNew notional value (day 2) – 10 *(1+1.0340%) = 10.1034 \\nSo, the new notional value is 10.1034, multiplying this with the number of \\nshares should result in the new investment value for the investor.  \\nAs you can see, the investment for each of the investors has gone up by the \\nsame percentage point, but the absolute money made by them diﬀers, based \\non the initial investment amount. \\nAlso, if you add up all the new investment amount, you will get the new fund \\nvalue, i.e. Rs.277,844/-. \\nBefore we wind up this chapter, I want you to remember these points in the \\ncontext of a mutual fund – \\n  \\n \\nAn investment fund is formed when diﬀerent people pool in their money \\nThe investment objective remains the same across all the investors \\nNotional value is assigned at the start of the fund formation, which then \\nfluctuates based on the daily investment value. In the Mutual fund world, this \\nis called the ‘ Net Asset Value ’. \\nA mutual fund’s net asset value or NAV is one of the most important metrics. \\nOn an end of day basis, the mutual fund company does the following \\ncalculations – \\nThe value of all the investments \\nExpenses of running the mutual fund \\nBased on these two parameters, the NAV of a fund is estimated daily. The \\nformula to calculate the NAV is – \\nNAV = (Value of all the assets – the expenses)/number of shares (units) \\nI’ll end this chapter here. I’ll be happy if you have fully understood the \\nconcept of what a fund is and the role NAV plays. \\nWe are still in the early stage of the learning curve, and we will revisit these \\ntopics. However, before I wind up this chapter, I have a question for you \\nrelated to the example we used in this chapter.  On day 3, suppose your father in law approaches you and wants to invest \\nRs.75,000/-, at what rate will you issue the shares to him? \\nWould it be Rs.10 (initial value) or Rs.10.1034/-? \\n  \\n \\nKey takeaways from this chapter \\n● In a mutual fund, diﬀerent people invest in a collective \\ninvestment vehicle with a common investment objective \\n● Every investor in a mutual fund is treated equally in terms of \\npercentage return \\n● At the start of the fund activity, every investor is issued \\nshares/units at a notional value \\n● The value of the shares/units change based on how invested \\nassets perform daily             \\n  \\n \\nCHAPTER  8 \\nThe mutual fund fact-sheet  8.1 – The Mutual Fund world \\nIn the previous chapter, we set up a hypothetical situation that helped us \\nunderstand the concept of a fund and how it gets managed. We discussed the \\nidea of ‘pooling of funds’ to invest in the market with a common purpose. I \\nagree we oversimplified the previous chapter, but that’s ok as the objective at \\nthis point is to understand the fund structure and the way it serves its \\ninvestors. \\nI also hope you are clear about the concept of ‘Net asset value or the NAV’. \\nThe mutual fund NAV or the mutual fund unit is an elementary concept, and I \\nhope you have no confusion about this. If yes, I would urge you to read the \\nprevious chapter once again. \\nWe will, in this chapter, take that conversation forward and look at one of the \\nmost crucial documents from a fund house, i.e. the Fund fact sheet. The \\nfactsheet is a document that puts up all the information related to a \\nfund/scheme. By and large, everything that you need to know before \\ninvesting in a particular fund is available in the fund fact sheet. In this \\nchapter, we will look at fund factsheet and figure out how to read and \\nunderstand the same. \\n  \\n\\n  \\nBefore we get to the fund’s fact sheet, I think it is essential to get a grip on \\nhow wide and deep the Indian Mutual fund industry is. The discussion will \\nhelp you understand the length and breadth of the mutual fund industry – \\nSo here are necessary details for you (as on Dec 2019) – \\nThe number of fund houses  –  43 . These are the number of mutual fund \\ncompanies who have obtained the AMC license from SEBI. Example: Kotak AMC, HDFC AMC, ICICI Pru AMC, Axis AMC, DSP etc. \\nThe number of scheme  –  2035 . Each fund house (AMC), can run multiple schemes for people to invest. For example, ICICI Pru AMC runs 243 diﬀerent \\nschemes, probably the highest in the industry. Franklin AMC runs about 67, \\nAditya Birla AMC manages around 163 schemes. A scheme is a fund with a \\nspecific investment objective, more about this when we dig into the \\nfactsheet. \\nMoney managed by AMCs  –  26L   Crore . This is the aggregate amount of \\nmoney managed by the entire mutual fund industry (across all AMCs). For \\n  \\n \\nexample, HDFC AMC, which is one of the largest AMC, manages about 3.7L \\nCrs. Axis AMC, on the other hand, manages about 1.05L Crs. Yes AMC manages \\nabout 916 Crs. This money is coming in from retail individuals and corporates. \\nOut of this 25.68L Crs, roughly 14.5L Cr is from retail investors like you and \\nme, and about 12L Crs is from the corporates \\nThe number of unique Investors  –  2 Crs Indians.  This is the number of \\nindividual investors investing in Mutual funds schemes across all the AMCs. \\nAgain, these are good to know numbers to put things in some perspective. \\nYou need not have to know these numbers if your objective is to invest in the \\nmarkets via mutual funds. \\n8.2 – The fund factsheet \\nAn asset management company (AMC), manages and runs a mutual fund \\nscheme. An AMC can run many schemes as long as they have SEBI’s approval \\nfor it. A mutual fund scheme is essentially a fund with a specific investment \\nobjective. An investment objective is the stated goal of the fund. For example, \\nthe investment objective of a mutual fund scheme could be an investment in \\nthe top 100 large-cap companies in the country or it could be an investment \\nin the top 100 small-cap companies, so on and so forth. The investment \\nobjective is stated at the inception of the fund, and the fund manager is \\nexpected to stick to this mandate until the life of the fund. \\nSo let us pick a fund fact sheet and dig into what information is available to \\nus. Let us start with Kotak AMC. \\nBy the way, I’ve randomly selected Kotak AMC, please don’t consider this as a \\nrecommendation of any sort 🙂   \\n \\nI can go to AMC’s website to find the fund’s factsheet. Here is the snapshot of \\nthe same –    \\nAs you can see, there are many diﬀerent tabs right at the top – Equity, Tax \\nSaver, Hybrid, Debt, Liquid etc. These are all diﬀerent categories of funds. \\nOver the next few chapters, we will understand what each of these categories \\nmeans and what to expect from investments made in these categories. For \\nnow, let us stick to ‘Equity’ as a category. As you can see, there are many \\ndiﬀerent funds/schemes under Equity as a category. Let us pick ‘Kotak Small \\nCap Fund’ and see what goes in the fact sheet. Click on the link, and you will \\nfind the fund’s factsheet. In Kotak’s case, they call this the ‘One Pager’. Fair \\nenough. \\nSEBI has mandated that the name of the fund should be indicative of what \\nthe fund is like to do. So moment I read, ‘Kotak Small Cap Fund’, I know that \\nthis is a fund which focuses on small-cap investments. \\nI’ve downloaded the fund’s one-pager, and here is the very first page – \\n  \\n  \\nThe introductory paragraph gives us information on the stated objective of \\nthe fund. As you can see, the stated objective says ‘Kotak Small Cap generates \\ncapital appreciation from a diversified portfolio of equity & equity-related \\nsecurities by investing predominantly in the small market capitalisation \\ncompanies across sectors’ \\nFrom this, we can infer – \\n1. The fund manager intends to have a diversified portfolio; therefore it is \\nnot focused on a specific sector \\n2. Investments are in Equity and equity-related securities. This is mainly \\nstocks \\n  \\n \\n3. Investments are predominantly in the small market capitalisation \\ncompanies, which means as the fund name suggests, they look at \\ninvestments in the small-cap company \\n4. The second section talks a bit about how they intend to research these \\nsmall-cap stocks. Frankly, this should not be of concern to you. I mean think \\nabout it – if you knew what to look for when investing in a stock or if you had \\nan opinion on what makes a good stock, then you are better oﬀ investing in \\nthe stocks directly right? Why mutual funds at all? \\nBut since the information is any way out there, here is a sneak peek into their research methodology – \\nLook at the integrity of the promoters  – necessarily ensure they are not \\nscammy \\nAbility to generate cashflow  – meaning they look for companies that are \\noperationally profitable and capable of producing a surplus over all the \\nexpenses \\nExperience of market cycles  – ensure that the company has survived \\nthrough the test of times and has proved its resilience \\nSimple business model  – No complicated verticals and easy to understand \\ncompanies \\nQuality metrics  – This means that all the financial ratios tick right \\nBusiness quality  – Good quality business I guess J \\nLow leverage  – Companies with very little or zero debt \\nNow, I can decipher this because I belong to the same industry. However, \\nmost of the investors cannot read through these terms, and frankly, as I \\nmentioned earlier, you don’t have to worry about this. \\n  \\n \\n8.3 – Other fund facts \\nThe fund fact sheet presents a lot more interesting data points. We will also \\nuse this opportunity to understand some of the key jargons used in the \\nmutual fund world. Here is the snapshot for the fund’s other facts –  \\nThe initial section is the investment objective, which we reviewed earlier, so \\nwe will skip this section. The next thing you can notice is the benchmark of \\nthe fund. A mutual fund scheme should essentially benchmark itself to an \\nindex. This is required to evaluate the performance of the fund over a period. \\nA mutual fund should have the appropriate benchmark. For example, a \\nsmall-cap fund is benchmarked against a small-cap index, as in this case. It is \\nalmost mis-spelling if the benchmark is not appropriate, for example, a \\nsmall-cap fund being benchmarked against a large-cap index. To put this \\ncontext, the performance of a family car such as Wagon R should \\n  \\n \\nbenchmarked against another family car such as maybe a Swi\\x00, and it would \\nbe futile to benchmark it against a Ferrari. \\nThe next section details the type of scheme; there are a couple of exciting \\nthings to note here. The type is– Open-ended, equity, growth scheme. There \\nare three critical parameters here; let us understand what it means. \\nOpen-ended  – When an AMC starts a fund, they have the option to let that \\nfund run for either a fixed period or keep it going forever. For example, I can \\nstart a fund today and let it run for three years from today, at the end of 3 rd \\nyear, the fund will cease to exist, and the investor is obligated to collect his \\nmoney back (along with the profit or losses). Funds with such defined time \\nare called a ‘ closes ended fund ’. If a fund does not have an expiry date, then \\nit’s called an open-ended fund. For all practical purposes, its always good to \\ndeal with an open-ended fund \\nEquity  – This is a reference to the asset class the mutual fund invests. Equity, \\nas you know, refers to the shares listed in the market. Another asset class is \\ndebt, which could be either corporate debt or PSU debt. More on this when \\nwe deep dive into debt funds \\nGrowth  – Let us skip this for now. We will discuss this in a bit. \\nApart from this, this section also details a few other things – Fund Manager  – I find this interesting to know who is managing the fund. I do \\na quick google search to know his background and his past performance. \\nA\\x00er all, he will be responsible for managing our hard-earned money, so it \\nmakes sense to see a bit about his background \\n  \\n \\nAllotment date  – This is the date from which the fund commenced its \\noperations. The allotment date gives you a sense of how old the fund is. It is \\nnot that it matters, but the older the fund, slightly easy it gets to analyse vis a \\nviz a new fund. \\nThe next section deals with ‘Plans & Options’. Under plans, there are two \\nvariants – \\nRegular plan  – This is interesting. Think about a farmer growing onions. He \\nnurtures the onion saplings, waters it, weeds it, and eventually harvests it \\nand gets the onion ready for consumption. Let us say the cost of the onion is \\nabout Rs.30/- per Kg at this point. An intermediary now acts as an ‘agent’ and \\ndelivers the onion to people like you and me, and we, in turn, pay him Rs.40/- \\nper Kg. The delta (Rs.10), is what the agent earns. Now replace the farmer \\nwith the AMC, the onions with a fund/scheme, and the agent as a mutual fund \\ndistributor. The mutual fund distributor is like the middleman between the AMC and the investor. If a mutual fund distributor approaches you and sells \\nyou a mutual fund, then he is selling you a ‘regular plan’, which means he is \\nentitled to receive a commission from the AMC for selling this fund to you. \\nThere is nothing wrong with this, except that the money is going from your \\npocket. \\nDirect plan  – Now you don’t need to buy the fund via a distributor. If you \\nknow which fund to buy, capable of doing your mutual fund research (which \\nby the way is the end objective of this module), then you can buy that fund \\ndirectly from the AMC. When you buy directly from the AMC, then there is no \\ndistributor involved; hence the distributor commissions are not paid, which \\n  \\n \\nmeans you save on commissions, which naturally means a better return on \\nyour investment. \\nJust to let you know, when you buy mutual funds via Zerodha, you are buying \\na direct plan; hence you will enjoy a better return. We will deep dive into this \\ntopic later in this module, but for now, remember when you invest in mutual \\nfunds, opt for a direct plan as you will save on commissions and therefore \\nenjoy the better return. \\nThe other bit in this section is about the option. As you can see, this fund has \\ntwo options – \\nDividend payout  – Think about it, when you buy a stock of a company and \\nthe company issues a dividend, then as an investor, you are entitled to \\nreceive these dividends right? Likewise, when the fund manager buys the \\nstock of a company, and the company issues a dividend, then the AMC \\nreceives this divided. Since the funds with the AMC belongs to the investors, \\nthis dividend belongs to the investors. The dividend you are entitled to obtain \\nfrom the AMC is to the extent you’ve invested in the fund. The AMC gives you \\ntwo options – you can withdraw this dividend, or you can choose to reinvest \\nthe dividend amount and buy more units of the fund. The dividend payout \\noption helps you withdraw the dividend as and when the dividend gets paid. \\nThere are technicalities here as to how the AMCs issue dividends. We will \\ndiscuss this at a later point. \\nDividend reinvestment plan  – This plan receives the dividend on your behalf \\nand reinvests the dividend into the same fund. So necessarily, you don’t get \\nthe dividend in the form of cash, but instead more units or NAV of the same \\nfund. \\n  \\n \\nGrowth plan –  In the growth plan, the investor does not receive any \\ndividends. The profits earned are ploughed back to fund and therefore the \\n‘compounding eﬀect’, works well here. I personally prefer this plan over the \\nother two. \\nNext up is the SIP details. SIP stands for ‘systematic investment plan’. In a \\ntypical SIP, you will invest the same amount of money every month for as \\nmany years as possible. Example of a SIP is investing say Rs.5000/- in Kotak \\nSmall-cap fund on 5 th  of every month for as many months as possible. Think \\nof SIP as investing in instalments. SIP is perhaps one of the most significant \\nfinancial inventions and has many merits to it. Given the importance of this \\ntopic, I think a separate chapter on this topic is justified, and we will do that \\nat a later point. For now, think of SIP in its basic form, i.e. to invest a fixed \\namount of money every month in the same fund for many years. \\nAs you can see, you can SIP on Kotak Small-cap fund, but for that, the AMC \\nhas specified that the minimum SIP amount every month is Rs.1000/- and the \\nminimum number of months is six. \\nThe next section talks about the initial minimum investment in the fund. This \\nis self-explanatory, if you choose not to SIP, then the minimum amount to \\ninvest is Rs.500/- and Rs.1000/- for the monthly SIP. \\nThe last section of the fact sheet talks about the load structure of the fund. \\nThere is a mention of few terms here like the SIP, STP, switches etc. We will \\nclub all these in the SIP chapter. For now, let’s talk about the ‘load structure’. \\nThe load structure is essentially the amount of money, in percentage terms; \\nyou will have to pay in case you wish to withdraw from the fund. As you can \\nsee, there are two types of load structure – \\n  \\n \\nEntry load  – This is no longer applicable. However, years ago, you’d have to \\npay a percentage for investing your money in a mutual fund. I guess AMC’s \\nhave to mention ‘entry load’ as nil for legacy reasons. \\nExit load  – This is the amount of money you will have to pay at the time of \\nwithdrawal. As you can see, there is a 1% load if you wish to withdraw before \\nthe completion of 1 year and no-load post that. \\n8.4 – Riskometer \\nEvery AMC is supposed to self-asses the riskiness of the fund and lets the \\ncustomers know about this. The self-assessment is something that SEBI \\nmandates to avoid cases of the misspelling of the financial product. For \\nexample, a small-cap fund should not be packaged as a low-risk fund and \\nsold to the investors. \\nHere is how the AMC does a self-assessment of risk –  \\nThe needle of the riskometer points to ‘moderately high’, meaning that the \\nKotak Smallcap fund is risky. The text next to the riskometer reiterates this. \\nNow, agreed this is a risky fund, but that should not stop you from investing \\nin risky funds. \\nRemember, the antidote for ‘risk’ in the mutual fund world is ‘time’; hence the \\nlonger you stay invested in a mutual fund, the safer it gets. \\n  \\n \\nMore on this in the next few chapters, so stay tuned. \\nKey takeaways from this chapter \\n● The factsheet of a mutual fund details all the essential \\nparameters worth knowing about the mutual fund \\n● The investment objective of a fund is essentially the guiding \\nprinciple for the investment the fund manager makes \\n● Open-ended funds don’t have an ‘expiry’ for the fund. It can go \\non forever \\n● Close-ended funds are time-bound \\n● Regular plans pay out distributor commissions, hence lower \\nyield to investors \\n● The direct plan does not pay distributor commissions; hence \\nthe returns are higher for the investor \\n● The MF investor can choose to receive or reinvest the \\ndividends \\n● Riskometer is a self-assessment of risk by the AMC   \\n  \\n \\nCHAPTER  9 \\nThe Equity scheme (Part 1)  \\n9.1 – October 2017 \\nThe previous chapter hopefully has given you some insights into reading a \\nmutual fund factsheet. The factsheet lists some of the good to know \\ninformation about a mutual fund. Do remember, the factsheet also doubles \\nup as a marketing document for the Asset Management Company (AMC), \\nhence read through the fund’s factsheet with a pinch of salt. \\nStarting from this chapter, we will shi\\x00 our focus on the mutual fund \\ncategories. The idea is to discuss the main categories and a few subcategories \\nof mutual funds. \\nPlease note, the term ‘subcategory’ in the context of mutual fund categories \\ndoes not exist, but I think it makes life simpler if you thought about the \\nmutual fund categories this way. \\nI’m not sure if we can cover all the subcategories in this module. For example, \\nDebt fund as a main mutual fund category has nearly 16 diﬀerent \\nsubcategories, equity as a category has about 10/11 subcategories. Given \\nthis, as you can imagine, discussing the entire gamut of MF categories will \\ndigress us from the central theme of this module which is personal finance. \\nThe idea here is to lay down a foundation for you to understand the main \\nmutual fund category (and a few subcategories) and hopefully, this \\n  \\n\\n \\nfoundation will help you understand the many subcategories of mutual fund \\nschemes. \\nNo discussion on the mutual fund universe is complete without touching \\nupon the SEBI’s October 2017 circular on MF categorisation. This circular from \\nSEBI was fairly significant, and it helped simplify the MF universe. To \\nappreciate why this SEBI circular is essential, we need to dig up a bit of \\nhistory. \\nBack in the days, the mutual fund world was a bit chaotic. The asset \\nmanagement companies would float many diﬀerent schemes with \\noverlapping investment ideologies. These funds would o\\x00en confuse or \\nmislead investors. For example, an AMC would run a ‘large-cap fund’, which \\nby definition should predominantly have only large-cap stock, but these \\nAMCs would stuﬀ in small-cap stocks, which as you can imagine bumps up \\nthe volatility (and the return) of the fund. A typical large-cap investor would \\nsign up for the market returns plus lower volatility, but the presence of \\nsmall-cap stocks in a large-cap fund kind of defeats the purpose. Here are a bunch of other problems that existed pre-Oct 2017; these \\nproblems existed mainly due to the lack of proper mutual fund classifications \\nand definitions. \\nMultiple funds  – An AMC would launch numerous funds with similar \\ninvestment objectives. For instance, it was common for an AMC to have \\nmultiple large-cap or mid-cap schemes, while all these funds had the same \\ninvestment objective. The distinction between the funds was not too clear. \\nLack of definition  – While an AMC would title their scheme as a large or \\nmid-cap fund, it would contain stocks from other market capitalisation. The \\n  \\n \\nproblem occurred because there was no formal definition of market \\ncapitalisation. \\nPortfolio composition  – The mutual fund schemes lacked a clear definition \\nin terms of portfolio composition. For instance, the portfolio of a mid-cap \\nfund is expected to hold mid-cap stocks, but it was common to find funds \\nwith a large proportion of small-cap stocks while the name of the fund \\nsuggested the fund was a mid-cap focused fund. \\nThese problems led to a series of other issues. One of the major concerns was \\nwith benchmarking of funds. A large-cap fund is benchmarked against a Ni\\x00y \\n50 index; now we have a problem if a fund with small-cap stocks gets \\ndisguised as a large-cap fund and gets benchmarked against a large-cap \\nindex. The performance of such a ‘large-cap fund’ (at least in bull markets) is \\nbound to get skewed and oﬀers an abnormal positive return, o\\x00en \\nmisleading the investor. \\nSEBI addressed these problems with the Oct 2017 circular. You can find the \\noriginal circular  here. \\nThe circular clearly defined the market capitalisation of stock, which naturally \\nsolved a few legacy issues in the mutual fund world. As per the definition – \\nLarge-cap stocks  – 1 st  to 100 th  company in terms of full market capitalisation \\nMid-cap stocks -  101 st  to 250 th  company in terms of full market capitalisation \\nSmall-cap stocks  – 250 th  company onwards in terms of full market \\ncapitalisation \\nWith this formal definition, there was no longer ambiguity on the market \\ncapitalization, and the AMCs were now forced to comply with the definitions. \\n  \\n \\nFurther, SEBI mandated that an AMC can have only one scheme in any \\ncategory (except for the thematic, index fund, and fund of funds). This \\nmandate put a stop to AMCs oﬀering a bouquet of schemes with an \\noverlapping investment thesis. To make things clear, SEBI defined the \\nportfolio composition as well. To put this context, post the circular, if an AMC \\nwere to run a large-cap fund, then SEBI not only defined what large-cap is but \\nalso set the minimum number of large-cap stocks (in % terms) the fund \\nshould hold in its portfolio. \\nAnyway, let us jump to the diﬀerent mutual fund categories and \\nsubcategories and start exploring them. The idea here is to understand these \\ncategories and invest in them based on our financial situation in life.  \\n9.2 – The Mutual fund universe \\nPrimarily, there are five diﬀerent categories of mutual funds under which \\nthere are many diﬀerent categories. Think of them as a ‘category – \\nsubcategory’ way of classification. Here are the main categories – \\n  \\n \\n1. Equity \\n2. Debt \\n3. Hybrid \\n4. Solution-oriented \\n5. Other schemes The entire ‘category – subcategory’ structure is as follows –  \\nTo begin with, we will focus on Equity as a category. As per SEBI’s circular, an \\nAMC is supposed to run only one scheme per category. For example, an AMC \\ncan have only one large-cap, one mid-cap, one small-cap so and so forth. \\nHowever, under Equity, an AMC can have multiple sectoral funds. \\n9.3 – Equity Category \\nThe equity category is perhaps the most popular MF category in terms of \\nretail participation. As the name suggests, the schemes under the equity \\ncategory invest in listed company shares. As you are aware, there are many \\ndiﬀerent styles of investment in the market. A  few of these popular styles \\nhave been picked and formally inducted into the ‘Equity category’. As you can \\nsee from the image above, here are nearly 11 diﬀerent subcategories within \\n  \\n \\nthe Equity category. Each of these categories is a diﬀerent style of investing in \\nthe market, and they all diﬀer in their risk and reward characteristics. \\nHowever, the general philosophy of investing in an equity scheme remains \\nthe same, i.e. to generate wealth. What diﬀers across these categories is \\nessentially the timeline of this wealth generation and like I mentioned, the \\nrisk and reward. \\nOver the years, thanks to my profession, I’ve had the opportunity to interact \\nwith many people about mutual fund investing. One thing that I can tell you \\nwith confidence is that most of them approach mutual fund investing (at least \\nin the equity funds) with unrealistic expectations. Some even go to the extent \\nof looking at mutual funds as a proxy for direct stock investing. They almost \\nhave a trading attitude with their funds. Such an approach to mutual fund \\ninvesting can have dangerous consequences for your capital. \\nUnless you have the right expectation and attitude towards equity investing, \\nit is nearly impossible to generate wealth from mutual fund investing. So \\nwhat is the right expectation/attitude when investing in an equity-oriented \\nmutual fund. \\nWell, the true answer to this question depends on the exact subcategory of \\nthe mutual fund you are looking at. However, here are a few generic pitfalls to \\navoid – \\nNot a short term solution  – Equity oriented mutual funds are not a solution \\nfor your short term financial goals. By short term, I mean 2-3 years kind of \\ntime frame. Invest in equity-oriented funds only if you have the necessary \\ntime it deserves. To put this in context, I started investing in an equity mutual \\nfund in 2006, it is the 14 th  year as of 2020, and I continue to invest in it. I’m not \\n  \\n \\nsuggesting that you need to stay invested for this long a period, all I’m trying \\nto say is that you need to have a super long term approach to mutual funds. \\nI’d say at least ten plus years (my personal opinion). Anything lower than this \\ncan be a futile attempt at wealth creation. \\nWhy not short term?  – One of the common follow up questions is why not \\nconsider equity mutual fund for short term investments. Well, there have \\nbeen instances where short term mutual fund returns have swelled. It \\nrequires a great amount of market study to figure and time this. Now, if you as \\na common man investing in the market can time the market, then why invest \\nin mutual funds at all? You may as well invest in stocks directly, right? \\nUnderstand time  – You may have heard of the saying, ‘time heals everything’. \\nWell, this is true for market volatility as well. The market is volatile; this is the \\nvery nature of this beast. However, the only way for a common man to deal \\nwith volatility is to give your investment suﬀicient time. Hence, a short term \\napproach to MF investing does not work. \\nDon’t keep switching  – I’ve seen investors switch between mutual funds as \\nthey would switch between their browsing tabs. Switching is essentially \\nredeeming the units from ‘Fund A’ to invest in ‘Fund B’, for no real reasons. In \\nmy opinion, this cannot be packaged as long term investing. The true \\ndefinition of long term investing is staying invested in a fund across a \\nmulti-year period (and across multiple market cycles). Of course, occasionally \\nthere will be justifiable reasons for you to switch between funds, we will \\nidentify these reasons at a later point. \\nHeadline investing  – Most investors get carried away by newspaper \\nheadlines. A headline which remotely hints at ‘bearishness’, is taken way too \\nseriously and used as a reason to exit an ongoing mutual fund investments. \\n  \\n \\nI’m guilty of doing this mistake myself. Back in 2007, I pulled out of a fund \\nthat was doing very well because I read a headline saying markets are likely \\nto go down shortly. The problem here is not just with the withdrawal; it is \\nactually with the fact that you are breaking an ongoing investment journey. I \\nwas never able to restart this investment. \\nTrust me; you will do far better than most of the investing public if you \\nunderstand these basic points which make a big diﬀerence to your investing \\njourney. Here is how my investments in Mutual funds have done till date –  \\nThese are all regular funds. Unfortunately, the direct fund option was not \\navailable back in the days. The returns would have been better, had I decided \\nto invest in the same fund, direct option. I’m in the process to transition all \\nmy regular to direct funds. Hopefully, this table should look better over the \\nnext decade 🙂 Also, I think three large-cap funds in my portfolio is an overkill, and perhaps I \\nshould look at replacing at least two of these funds with a low-cost index \\nfund. At a later stage, I’ll share my thoughts on this topic related to asset \\nallocation and fund diversification. \\nWe will now proceed to understand a few of these subcategories of equity \\nmutual funds. \\n9.4 – The Equity mutual fund subcategories \\n  \\n \\nUnder the broad classification of equity funds, there are nearly ten \\nsubcategories. As you may have noticed, the name of these subcategories is \\nquite descriptive and gives out a general idea about what to expect from such \\na fund. \\nLarge-cap fund  – As the name suggests, a large-cap equity fund indicates \\nthat the fund invests predominantly in large-cap stocks. These are the top \\n100 companies in India, with the largest market capitalisation. The \\nexpectation is that these companies are also market leaders in the industry \\nthey belong to. These companies are also supposed to be stable and safe. \\nExamples of large-cap stocks include companies like TCS, Reliance, Infosys, \\nHDFC Bank, etc. \\nHave a look at the portfolio of one of the large-cap mutual fund schemes. \\nThis is the portfolio of Axis Bluechip fund –  \\nAs you can see, the portfolio predominantly contains large-cap stocks (80%), \\ninvested in varying proportions. The weight assigned to each stock is the fund \\nmanager’s prerogative. By the way, you may be interested to know that by \\nregulation, once a month, the AMC is supposed to disclose the portfolio \\n  \\n \\ndetails. So go to the AMC’s website and lookup for any fund you are interested \\nin, and you’ll find the portfolio details in the ‘statutory disclosure’, section. \\nUsually, when an investor decides to invest in a large-cap fund, he has a twin \\nagenda – (1) capital appreciation in line with the markets, (2) low volatility. By \\nlow volatility here, I mean with respect to small and mid-cap funds. \\nIn simple words, this means that the investor is looking at wealth creation but \\nwith not so much risk to his capital. Do remember, these are large-cap stocks, \\nmeant to be stable hence less volatile. Of course, by virtue of investing in the \\nstock market either directly or via a mutual fund, the capital is exposed to \\nvolatility. Like I mentioned earlier, the only antidote to volatility is time. So it \\ngoes without saying that you need to stay invested for a long period to factor \\nin the volatility and generate decent returns. \\nHere is a look at how the top large-cap mutual funds have performed over the \\nlast ten years. I’ve defined ‘top’, by considering the size of the fund’s AUM. I’ve \\ntaken this data from Moneycontrol –  \\nThe key point to note here is the positive return across all the funds against a \\nlong investment horizon. \\n  \\n \\nMid-cap/small cap/large & midcap funds –  I guess the names are quite clear \\nfor us to know what to expect from the fund. \\nThe mid-cap fund predominantly consists of mid-cap stocks and the \\nsmall-cap funds contain small-cap companies. The volatility in mid and \\nsmall-cap stocks is quite high. Like the large-cap stocks, investment in these \\nfunds should be long term. You cannot aﬀord to invest on a short term basis \\nin these funds. For example, here is how the small and mid-cap funds have \\nperformed over the last two years –  \\nThe last two years have been particularly bad for the small and mid-cap \\nstocks, and this is evident across the fund’s returns. I’m not trying to say that \\nthe returns across all two years or three years (or any short term cycle) will \\nalways be bad. It depends on the market; however, for a common man, it is \\nnearly impossible to time the market and calls the cycles. Hence when we \\ninvest, we should have a long term agenda, or at least have the intent to stay \\ninvested for the long term. \\nHere is how some of these small and mid-caps have performed over the last \\nten years – \\n  \\n  \\nAll the funds have delivered a fairly decent positive return. Also, notice the \\nten-year performance of small and mid-cap funds are better than the large-cap funds; this should be evident to you because small and mid-cap \\nfunds are more volatile compared to large-cap funds. \\nThe intent behind investing in either of these funds is the same as large-cap \\ni.e. wealth creation over a long period. However, you expect a return much \\nhigher than a large-cap fund (against much higher volatility). This is obvious \\nbecause the fund contains companies which have a long headroom for \\ngrowth. As the company grows, so would the returns. \\nThe  large and mid-cap fund  is a cocktail of both mid and large-cap stocks. \\nUnlike an exclusive large/mid/small-cap fund, the ‘large & mid’ cap fund is \\nexpected to have 35% of its investment in large-cap and another 35% in \\nmid-cap stocks. For example, this  DSP large and mid-cap fund  has stocks like \\nInfosys, Airtel, HDFC Bank, and also, stocks like Hexaware, Hatsun Agro, and V \\nGuard. Technically the fund can be a 65% large (or mid) and 35% mid (or \\nlarge) cap stocks. The extent of the skew depends on the fund manager. \\nSince the large and mid-cap fund is a mixed bag, the expectation on the \\nreturn front is slightly higher than a regular large-cap fund but lower than a \\nsmall-cap fund. The risk is higher than a large-cap fund but lower compared \\nto mid or small-cap fund. Here is how the returns for small and mid-cap stack \\nup for the last ten years – \\n  \\n   \\nBy the way, given that there are so many AMCs and therefore so many \\ndiﬀerent funds for the same category, how would one narrow down on a \\nsingle fund to invest in? Well, this is a diﬀerent topic altogether, and it \\ninvolves looking at various parameters on risk, returns, performance, and \\ncosts. We will take this up a\\x00er we finish all our discussions on MF categories. \\nIn the next chapter, we will discuss the remaining few Equity subcategories \\nand then move to debt.      \\n  \\n  \\nKey takeaways from this chapter \\n● Large-cap stocks – 1 st  to 100 th  company in terms of full market \\ncapitalization \\n● Mid-cap stocks – 101 st  to 250 th  company in terms of full market \\ncapitalization \\n● Small-cap stocks – 250 th  company onwards in terms of full \\nmarket capitalisation \\n● Large-cap funds should contain at least 80% in large-cap \\nstocks. Large-cap funds are expected to have lower volatility \\nand steady returns \\n● Mid-cap and small-cap funds have higher volatility and return \\nexpectation compared to the large-cap funds \\n● Mid and large-cap stocks contain at least 35% each of mid and \\nlarge-cap stocks.   \\n  \\n \\nCHAPTER  10 \\nEquity Scheme (Part 2)  \\n10.1 – Multicap funds  \\nWe discussed the equity scheme and a few of its subcategories in the \\nprevious chapter. We will take that discussion forward in this chapter. \\nNext up is the multi-cap funds. As the name implies, a multi-cap fund is not \\nbound to particular market capitalization. The fund manager is free to pick \\nstocks from the entire market and create a diversified portfolio (the \\ndiversification is mainly in terms of market capitalization). In a sense, the \\nfund manager is chasing opportunities that he thinks make sense. The only \\nmandate for a multi-cap fund is that it should consist of 65% investments in \\nequity and related instruments. \\nHave a look at the portfolio of  SBI’s Multicap fund  –   \\n\\n  \\nThe portfolio contains large-cap stocks like HDFC Bank Ltd to a relatively \\nsmall company like UFO Moviez Ltd. Of course, the investments in these \\nstocks are of varying degrees; this is the Fund manager’s call. The portfolio \\nmix in terms of capitalization is also dependent on the fund manager. The \\nportfolio mix for SBI multi-cap fund looks like this –  \\n  \\n \\nNow, given the fact that the fund is diversified across the diﬀerent market \\ncapitalization, the AMCs tend to benchmark multi-cap funds to the S&P BSE \\n500 index or the NSE 500 index. These indices are broad and contain the top \\n500 companies by market capitalization. \\nGiven the fact that the multi-cap fund has a mix of market capitalization, the \\nreturn expectation is on the higher side. The higher return expectation is also \\nassociated with a higher risk. Here is a summary of the returns from Multi cap \\nfunds for 10 years – \\n  \\n  \\nAs you can see, the returns average about 10 – 11%, the lowest being 7.36% \\nand higher is around 16%. \\nThis leads us to an interesting point. The AMC is an asset-gathering machine. \\nIt tries to attract more and more funds to its schemes. Imagine, a multi-cap \\nfund does the asset gathering part very well and gathers a ton of assets. What \\ndo you think will happen to this fund? \\n  \\n \\nWell, as the asset size grows, they will have to deploy this fund into stocks. \\nUnfortunately, in the Indian stock markets, the liquidity in the small-cap \\nspace is not much, hence the fund is forced to invest the funds in large and \\nmid-cap funds. \\nHence, as the asset base grows, a Multi cap fund tends to work like a large \\nand mid-cap fund. This probably explains why the SBI Multicap fund (8.5K \\nCrore in AUM) has nearly 70% of its investments in large-cap stocks. \\nThe one thing you need to keep in mind when investing in a multi-cap fund is \\nthe ‘fund manager’ risk. Since the fund invests in stocks across the spectrum, \\nthe performance is largely dependent on the kind of stocks and the \\nproportion the fund manager decides to invest. \\nBy the way, in my opinion, if you are completely new to mutual funds and \\ndon’t know where to start and which category to pick, then I’d suggest you \\nstart with a multi-cap fund. Think of this as going for a buﬀet dinner, where \\nyou get a bit of everything. \\n10.2 – Focused Funds \\nWe have discussed a few equity categories by now. I hope you’ve looked at \\nthe fact sheet and portfolio composition of some of the funds. If you have, \\nthen one thing that comes across quite evidently is the number of stocks in \\nthe portfolio. It is very common for equity mutual funds to have a large \\nportfolio size (in terms of the number of stocks), the numbers average to \\nabout 60-70 stocks in a typical equity portfolio. \\nThe common theory is that the higher the number of stocks, the lower is your \\nrisk (and of course the return). \\n  \\n \\nA focused fund does things diﬀerently. The focused funds, as the name \\nsuggests, contains a maximum of 30 stocks in the portfolio, thereby creating a \\nconcentrated portfolio. A concentrated portfolio is a portfolio with few stocks \\n(max 30 in this case), but each stock is picked only a\\x00er rigorous due \\ndiligence. In the investment world, they call this high conviction bets. The \\naverage number of stocks in focused funds is about 25 and if I’m not wrong, \\nJM Financials’s focused fund is perhaps the only fund with just about 11 \\nstocks. They call this fund the core 11. Their portfolio looks like this –  \\nSince the number of stocks is limited in a focused fund, the risk and return \\nprofile of the focused fund changes drastically compared to other equity \\nmutual funds. As you can imagine, the focused funds oﬀer the possibility of a \\nhigher return along with higher risk. \\nHave a look at the return profile of the focused mutual fund – \\n  \\n  \\nOver the last ten years, the returns range from 7.25% on the lower side to \\n16.75% on the higher side. These returns should give you a sense of how the \\nrisk profile of the focused funds. \\nI like to think of a focused fund as a poor man’s ‘Portfolio Management \\nServices’, you get similar returns at a much lower cost and entry criteria. \\nThis also leads me to the next point – the focused fund is not for someone \\nwho is starting his or her mutual fund investment journey. I’m saying this \\nbecause the focused fund will be a lot more volatile compared to a diversified mutual fund. I think it is very important to familiarize oneself with the volatile \\nnature of these investments and slowly ease up to the idea of market-linked \\ninvestments. If you start straight away with Focused funds, I’m afraid this \\nexperience will be a bit harsh and may convince you to never look at MF as an \\n  \\n \\ninvestment option. I think a focused fund will be a great addition to the \\nmutual fund portfolio at a slightly mature state in the investment journey. \\n10.3 – Dividend yield funds \\nI wish there were a diﬀerent name for this mutual fund category. The moment \\nyou see ‘dividend yield’ as a part of the fund’s name, it is only natural to \\nexpect that the mutual fund pays out regular dividends to its investors. \\nHowever, this is not true at all. A dividend yield fund (or for that matter any \\nother mutual fund) is under no obligation to pay out a dividend to its \\ninvestors. \\nGiven this, why do you think a dividend yield fund is called a dividend yield \\nfund? Well, the name is representative of the strategy the fund follows. The \\nstrategy as you can imagine involves investing in companies that payout \\n(high)` dividends regularly. \\nDividend yield = Dividend paid during the year/ stock price \\nFor example, if Infosys trading at Rs.780/- per share pays a dividend of Rs.22/- \\nfor the year, then Infosys’s dividend yield is – \\n= 22/780 \\n=  2.8% \\nHere is SEBI’s definition for this category –  \\n  \\n \\nAs you can see, the fund is predominantly invested i.e. at least 65% in \\ndividend-yielding stocks. There are two aspects to this – \\nThe fund invests 65% of the corpus in dividend-yielding stocks; the balance \\n35% is open for other investments, which means that this portion (35%) may \\nbe invested in non-dividend-yielding stocks \\nIdeally, these funds should invest in high dividend-yielding stocks. So one has \\nto define what ‘high dividend’ really means. The lack of clear definition leads \\nto inconsistencies in-stock selection. For example, a fund manager simply \\nstates that high dividend yield is anything greater than 0.75% and another \\nfund manager may want to benchmark it against the indices dividend yield. \\nFor example, check out the UTI Dividend yield fund –  \\nThey benchmark themselves to the Ni\\x00y Dividend opportunity 50 indexes. \\nThe fund’s portfolio, as you can imagine consists of companies which are well \\nestablished and consistent dividend-paying – \\n  \\n  \\nThe last ten-year performance of dividend yield funds are as follows – \\nAs you can see, the performance is fairly standard across these funds. \\nI’m personally not a big fan of dividend yield fund simply because I prefer to \\ntake that extra risk with growth stocks. Of course, the decision to invest or not \\nto invest depends on the portfolio goals of the individual.   \\n  \\n \\n10.3 – ELSS Funds \\nThe ‘Equity-linked Savings Scheme’ or the ELSS funds are a special category \\nof mutual funds that enjoy tax exemption on investments made under \\nsection 80C of the Indian Income-tax Act, 1961. \\nAs you may be aware, section 80C in the income tax act allows you to reduce \\nyour tax burden by accommodating for certain investments and payments \\nmade during the financial year, the reduction in the tax burden, however, is \\nup to Rs.1,50,000/- per year. \\nFor example, if you have a total gross yearly income of Rs.1,200,000/- then \\nyou can choose to invest Rs.1,50,000/- in various 80C options and reduce the \\ntax burden. If you do so, your taxable income reduces to 1,050,000/-. \\nAmongst the various investment options permitted under section 80C, \\ninvestments in ELSS mutual fund is one of them. You can choose to invest \\neither the entire permitted amount of Rs.1,50,000/- in ELSS or split this \\namount across many diﬀerent schemes such as Life Insurance, Public \\nProvident Fund, five year FD, Sukanya Smariddi Yojana, etc. \\nThe decision to do so depends on your overall financial planning strategy. Of \\ncourse, we will discuss this more as we progress in this module. \\nHere is how SEBI describes an ELSS fund –  \\nThere are two important things to note here – \\n  \\n \\nELSS funds have a mandatory lock-in of 3 years. I guess this the Government’s \\nway of inculcating long term investing behavior 🙂 ELSS funds have a mandate to invest 80% of the funds in equity and \\nequity-related instruments. There is no restriction on the market \\ncapitalization of stocks. \\nMany people wrongly assume that ELSS funds are a proxy for a pure large-cap \\nfund but this is not entirely true. ELSS mutual fund, in general, can probably \\nbe considered as a proxy for a multi-cap fund. The data below helps you \\nunderstand this –  \\n  \\n \\nThat’s the list of the 40 top ELSS funds and as you can see, 23 funds have less \\nthan 70% in large-cap stocks and 17 of them have over 70% invested in \\nlarge-cap stocks. Some of the funds like the IDFC Tax Advantage Fund have a \\nfairly decent mix across all market capitalization, which makes it a clean \\nmulti-cap fund. \\nAgain, when you select an ELSS fund, the decision should depend on your \\noverall portfolio structure. For example, there is no point in having a \\nlarge-cap fund and again opting to invest in a fund like HDFC Taxsaver, \\nbecause HDFC Taxsaver has 83% invested in the large-cap stock. \\nThe performance of ELSS funds for the last ten years is as follows – \\n  \\nThese are for a few of the top funds in terms of AUM. As you can see, the returns average about 11-12%, which I think is in line with the multi-cap fund. I think the last two chapters have laid down a brief introduction to equity mutual funds. We will now proceed to understand the basics of debt funds and cover as many subcategories as possible. Once we are through with this, we will proceed to understand the techniques of selecting a mutual fund and building a mutual fund portfolio. All of this and more in the coming few chapters. So stay tuned for more 🙂 \\nThe key takeaway from this chapter ● A multi-cap fund does not have any restrictions on where it can invest. The manager invests in any stocks across market caps (large, mid, and small) where he sees opportunities. ● One of the risks to watch out for in a multi-cap fund is the ‘fund manager risk.’ ● A focused fund consists of not more than 30 stocks in its portfolio. These are high conviction bets by the fund manager ● The risk and return of a focused fund is higher compared to any other equity oriented fund ● A dividend yield fund does not mean the fund pays regular dividends to its investors ● The dividend yield fund invests in high dividend-yielding stocks ● ELSS funds are tax saving funds under section 80C of the Indian Income Tax act 1961 ● A maximum investment of 1,50,000/- is permitted under ● An ELSS fund is considered a proxy for a multi-cap fund \\nCHAPTER 11 The Debt Funds (Part 1) 11.1 – The origins of debt Over the next couple of chapters, we will cover the basics of debt mutual funds. As you may recollect from the earlier chapters, there are about 16 debt mutual fund categories. I don’t intend to discuss all these categories of a mutual fund, because a typical investor does not need these many categories of debt investment. Instead, I’ll discuss the following which I think are essential – 1. Liquid funds 2. Overnight funds 3. Ultrashort term funds 4. Medium duration 5. Dynamic bonds 6. Corporate bond 7. Credit Risk 8. Banking & PSU 9. GILT funds (2 different types) In my opinion, this is a fairly exhaustive list and will cover many different investment situations which may arise. However, if you would like to know more about a category which isn’t discussed here, then please do post a comment and I’ll be happy to give you clarifications in the comment section. Zerodha.com/varsity\\nThe debt-oriented, liquid, and overnight funds together constitute nearly 50% of the 27 lakh crore assets under management (AUM) in the mutual fund industry (as of Jan 2020). So as you can imagine, this is a relatively large chunk of investor money. The debt funds play an essential role in the investor’s portfolio, and it serves a variety of purposes, including capital protection. Before we understand how and when to use a debt fund, we need to understand a more fundamental concept, i.e. The origin of debt. To help you understand this, I’ll take the example of a simple debt structure, which I guess we all would have come across directly or indirectly in our daily lives. So let’s get started. Assume you want to buy an apartment. You do your research and shop around for the apartment with a checklist. After an exhaustive search, you eventually circle in on your dream apartment. The apartment comes with everything that you ever wanted – swimming pool, clubhouse, convention centre, \\nsupermarket, tennis court, and everything else desirable. The apartment costs you a sweet 1.5Cr, all-inclusive. You have 40L stashed away in your bank, which suffices as the down payment. You still need 1.1Cr to fund the property purchase. How will you source the additional fund? Chances are, you will approach a bank and request for a loan. The bank evaluates your request and either give you a loan or denies the loan. Needless to say, before deciding to provide you with a loan, the bank will do a ton of background work and dig up every bit of information about you. One of the critical inputs for the bank is your credit score issued by agencies such as CIBIL or Experian. The credit score is a reflection of your creditworthiness, higher the rating the better it is for you and of course, a low credit score implies no loan or a loan at an exorbitant interest rate. So let us just assume that you have a fantastic credit score and the bank decides to give you a loan of 1.1Cr against your apartment purchase. The details of your loan are as follows – Credit score: 850 Amount: Rs.1,10,00,000/- Tenure: 10 years or 120 months Interest rate: 8.5% Total interest payable: Rs.53,66,129/- Total payable (Int + Principal): Rs.1,63,66,129/- Monthly EMI= Rs.1,36, 384/- \\nThere are plenty of online calculators you can use to get these details. I’ve used the one available on Bajaj Finserv site. Of course, the credit score is arbitrary here 🙂 These details, along with a bunch of terms and conditions are printed on a document. A stamp paper is attached with stamp duty paid, and the document is registered. Finally, both the parties sign off. A document such as this is called a loan agreement. Finally, the loan amount is credited from the bank to your bank account. The apartment will remain hypothecated to the bank till the entire loan amount is repaid. The hypothecation works as backup security for the bank. In case you refuse to repay the loan, the bank can sell your apartment and make good their principal and interest. From the bank’s perspective, the loan is a ‘collateralised loan’, because the loan is secured against collateral, i.e. The property in this case. A collateralised loan is a safer bet for the bank as opposed to a non-collateralised loan. At this point, I want you to recognise how a debt obligation is created. A debt obligation is created when a person needs to carry out an economic activity for which the fund requirement is far higher than what is available to him. Going back to the apartment case, assuming things go smoothly, on every month, for the next ten years the borrower is expected to pay back a sum of, i.e. Rs.1,36, 384/- to the bank. The regular inflow to the bank is the ‘cash flow’. Zerodha.com/varsity\\nSo far, so good, this is a reasonably simple debt structure to understand. Let us now shift focus on the risk involved here. By risk, I mean the risk involved for the banker, i.e. The lender. What do you think can give the lender sleepless night? There are a couple of things that can go wrong – Cashflow risk – The borrower can skip paying a couple of EMIs and make irregular repayments. Irregular repayments mean that the bank will take a hit on the expected cash flow, potentially leading to a chain of undesirable events Default risk – The borrower may get into an insolvent situation wherein servicing the loan becomes very difficult; hence the borrower decides not to repay. This is called ‘default’ or the ‘default risk’. Interest rate risk – The loan is given out at a specific interest rate. However, the economic situation may change, and the interest rates may drop in the future. This means that the bank will be forced to reduce the rates, and hence the expected cash flow takes a hit. Credit rating risk – The bank evaluates the borrower’s credit rating at the time of giving out the loan. At this point, the borrower’s credit rating could be excellent. However, for whatever reasons, the credit rating of the borrower can suddenly degrade, thereby increasing the chance of default risk. Asset risk – In case the borrower defaults, the bank has the right to sell the hypothecated property. What if the property itself loses its value? This is a double whammy situation for the lender or the bank. The bank loses both the principal and the asset. Zerodha.com/varsity\\nThese are the most common risk associated with a debt obligation. We have taken the example of a bank and an individual, the same can be extended to corporates as well. Imagine a manufacturing company wants to build a new plant. The company needs about INR 800 Crores to commission this plant. How can they raise this money? There are two ways the company can raise this money – Approach a bank and seak a loan, pretty much like the apartment case we discussed Instead of a bank, the company can choose to raise a smaller amount of money from several people (investors) . Say in multiples of 20Crs. The company, instead of paying interest to the bank, now pays the interest amount to multiple investors. If the company takes the 1stapproach and seeks a loan from the bank, then the binding agreement is called the ‘loan agreement’. On the other hand, if the company decides to raise this money from multiple investors (multiple lenders) , then the binding agreement is called ‘ bond ’. Think of a bond as a promissory note from the company to its investors/lenders promising to repay the principal amount at the end of the tenure and a periodic interest amount, also called a coupon. I agree this is a rather crude and unconventional way to introduce the concept of ‘bond’ to you, but I hope you get the point. A bond is a debt product wherein the lender with surplus capital provides capital to the borrower who requires the capital. In exchange for the \\nmoney, the borrower promises to pay interest (coupon payments) and repay the full principal at the end of the tenure. As simple as that. The risks that we discussed in the bank-apartment example applies to bonds as well. Three risks matter the most when it comes to the bonds – Credit risk Interest rate risk Price risk At this point, if you’ve managed to understand what a bond is, the risk applicable (very briefly) then I suppose we are off to an excellent start to learn more about the debt funds. Remember this though – debt funds and the functioning of debt funds is one thing and investing (or trading) the bond is another thing. You as mutual fund investors should only be concerned about three things – When to invest in a debt fund and how to choose one? What a particular category of debt fund does The risk associated with that category of debt fund The fund manager of the debt fund should be concerned about investing or trading in the bond market. The bond market is a reasonably big market, not just in India but across the world. Companies often issue bonds to full fill their \\ncapital requirements and these bonds are subscribed by the investors. The mutual fund companies which have the capital subscribe to bonds issued by the companies which have a capital requirement. With this background, let’s start discussing the different categories of debt funds. 11.2 – The liquid fund The liquid fund is perhaps the most popular debt fund within the debt fund universe. A liquid fund makes investments in debt products which have a maximum maturity of up to 91 days. In simple words, the liquid fund invests in debt obligations, wherein the borrower promises to repay the borrowed money (principal) within 91 days (maturity) of such borrowing. Here is a typical example – Power Finance Corporation (PFC) of India needs 150 Crs to fund its working capital requirement. They agree to repay the borrowed amount to the lender within 50 days. PFC agrees to pay 8.5% interest (also referred to as the coupon) against this borrowing. HDFC AMC has 150Cr to invest; they see this as an excellent opportunity to earn 8.5% interest; hence they give the funds to PFC. The deal is done. After 50 days, PFC repays 150Cr to HDFC AMC along with 8.5% interest. Zerodha.com/varsity\\nNote, when any interest or coupon rate is quoted, it is quoted on an annual basis. So this is 8.5% for the 365 days. For 50 days, interest on a pro-rata basis is – = (50 * 8.5%)/365 = 1.164% So HDFC AMC will get back 150 Cr + 1.746Cr back from PFC. I suppose this is a relatively simple deal to understand. Like I mentioned earlier, a liquid fund by regulation can invest in debt which has a maximum maturity of 91 days. When a corporate entity borrows for such short term basis, they do so by issuing something called as a ‘ commercial paper ’ or Cps. In the arbitrary PFC example I used, PFC is deemed to have issued a 50 day CP, which was subscribed by HDFC AMC. The Government too borrows on a short term basis to fund its short term financial needs. However, when the Government borrows, it does not issue a CP but instead issues a treasury bill. The Government has three variants of t-bills – 1. 91-day T\\ue088Bills, the maturity of 91 days 2. 182-day T\\ue088Bill, the maturity of 182 days 3. 365 day T-bills, the maturity of 365 days You can read more about the treasury bills or the T\\ue088Bills here. Now, place yourself as a lender, someone with surplus capital. You are looking for an opportunity to invest 100 Crs. There are two possible borrowers, both wanting 100Crs each – \\nA sugar manufacturer willing to offer 6.5% coupon The Govt of India provides a 6.5% coupon Whom would you lend? This is a no brainer; you’d give to the Govt because you know that with the Government, there is no credit risk. The Govt will repay, but the same cannot be said about the sugar manufacturer. Does this mean that the sugar manufacturer will never get the required funds? Yes, as long as the sugar manufacturer offers a coupon equivalent to the Govt, it will be hard for them to source the fund. The lender will lend if he is compensated for credit risk; hence the coupon has to be higher than the equivalent T-bill. So in this case, the sugar manufacturer should offer say 7 or 8%. Let’s extend this thought. Assume there are two sugar manufacturing companies – Company A with an impeccable track record. It is in business for 25 years, profitable, and steady cash flows. Company B, five years of operations, breaking even, backed by young entrepreneurs. Both need 100 Crs. Both offer 8%, you have the money, whom would you lend? Company A, of course, because company A has a better financial history, hence lesser probability of default. Does that mean, Company B will never get the funds? Of course, they will, as long as they compensate the lender for the additional credit risk. Hence company B has to offer something like 10 of 11%. Zerodha.com/varsity\\nThe credit rating reveals the credit risk of a company. The credit rating of the equivalent to an individual’s CIBIL score. The higher, the better, which also means companies with higher credit rating can borrow money by offering lower coupons. In its portfolio, the liquid fund contains several CPs and T bills, while T bills are relatively safer, CPs aren’t. This leads me to the most critical point about liquid funds. 11.3 – Why liquid fund? People invest in liquid funds to park cash, which they intend to use sometime soon. By ‘sometime soon’, I mean within a year or at the most within a year and a half. The purpose of this investment is to protect the capital, use it in its entirety for the purpose planned. So think about the liquid fund as a parking space for your excess funds. Question is – why to invest in a liquid fund and why not let it be in a bank’s savings account. Well, people opt to invest in a liquid fund because the liquid fund offers a slightly higher return compared to the bank’s savings account. The problem, however, is the fact that the liquid fund is often pitched as a better than a savings account (SA) or the fixed deposit (FD)’. This is not true at all. A liquid fund may offer higher than SA/FD account, but also comes with a certain amount of risk. Zerodha.com/varsity\\nTo put this in perspective, an average SB account rate as of today (Feb 2020) is 3.5% to 4% whereas the average Liquid fund gives you a 6% return. However, the liquid funds consist of several CPs, which are suspectable to credit risk. Here is the snapshot of HDFC’s Liquid funds – As you can see, HDFC Liquid Funds has several CPs its portfolio. Of course, the credit ratings of the issuer of these CPs are all good, but then things change quickly in the markets. A downgrade in the issuer’s credit rating means a steep cut in the NAV of the liquid fund. HDFC’s portfolio also has Government securities, which virtual consists of no credit risk, thanks to the implicit sovereign guarantee. Zerodha.com/varsity\\nWhile this is a good liquid fund, it is still not risk-free, you can lose your money if something were to go wrong, which is not the case with a SA or FD. To give you a perspective of how bad things can go, check this – This is the NAV graph of Taurus AMC’s Liquid fund. The NAV fell close to 7% on a single day in Feb 2017. All gains were wiped off, and in fact, the investors took a hit on their investment capital. It took almost a year for the fund to recover back to its previous levels. The reason for this fall was that Taurus had nearly 2000Cr of CPs issued by Ballarpur Industries. The credit rating agencies downgraded Ballarpur’s CPs, and that translated into a 7% vertical fall in NAV. Zerodha.com/varsity\\nAnyway, I’d suggest you read this news article, and I think it puts all the discussion we have had till now in some perspective. So if you are investing in Liquid funds, you need to be aware of a few things – Invest only to park your spare cash Expect a return slightly higher to your SA account Liquid fund is not risk-free, you can lose money when you invest in it Choose a fund which has relatively less default risk – meaning the liquid fund portfolio should have a higher concentration of Government securities. I’ll stop this chapter here. In the next chapter, I’ll discuss the close cousin of the liquid fund, i.e. The ultra short term fund. Stay tuned. Zerodha.com/varsity\\nKey takeaways from this chapter ● When a corporate entity borrows funds (for more than one year) , they do so by issuing bonds ● Corporate borrowings for less than a year is done via the issuance of a commercial paper or the CPs ● When the Government borrows, they do so by issuing a treasury bill or the T\\ue088Bill ● Against the borrowing, the borrower pays interest (coupon) to the lender ● The lender faces multiple risks when lending funds to the borrower ● Credit risk and interest rate risk is the primary risk for the lender ● Liquid funds invest only in CPs and T bills with a maximum maturity of 91 days ● Liquid fund is not a proxy for a savings bank account; it carries credit risk. Zerodha.com/varsity\\nCHAPTER 12 The Debt Funds (Part 2) 12.1 – Overnight Fund We are in living in strange times, as I write this, the market is down nearly 30% from its peak. I’ve seen markets get hammered for a variety of reasons – recessions, business cyclicality, fraud, political unrest, civil unrest, geopolitical tensions, wars, and heck even family feuds. But never in my wildest dreams could I imagine the markets getting trashed owing to a virus of an unknown origin. I guess with COVID 19, we have seen it all. At least, I hope so: ) . Nevertheless, we have to do what we have to do. So let us get back to the debt funds. Zerodha.com/varsity\\nIn the previous chapter, we introduced the concept of a bond or a debt structure and discussed the first debt mutual fund, i.e. The liquid fund. Do recall; the liquid fund is not risk-free as most people assume, it is susceptible to both default and credit rating risk. The Taurus MF and Ballarpur example highlighted this credit risk in liquid funds. Both these risk types are significantly reduced (not eliminated) in an overnight debt fund. Remember, a liquid fund invests in papers maturing up to 91 days, this typically includes both the corporate commercial papers and the Govt’s treasury bills. An overnight fund, on the other hand, invests in securities which have one-day maturity. Think of this as lending money to someone for one day only. So at the start of the day, the Fund manager of an overnight Fund lends to ‘someone’ which is recovered back in 24 hours. This is precisely what happens in an ‘overnight debt mutual fund’. Given the fact that the overnight fund invests (or lends) to 1-day debt obligation, the chance of a change in credit rating risk is low. The default risk still exists, although it is small. The next obvious question is – who are these overnight fund lending to? Well, the overnight loan happens to an RBI regulated money market instrument called ‘Tri party Repo’ or the ‘TREPS’. I’ll not get into the details of what a TREP is and its purpose, I think that will stray us from the main focus of this chapter. All you need to know is that a TREP is a relatively safe instrument wherein the act \\nof lending and borrowing happens over a 24hr window. You can read more about TREPs here – - https: //www.ccilindia.com/FAQ/Pages/TREPS.aspx#1 I want you to look at the portfolio of HDFC Overnight Fund – As you can see, the entire portfolio consists of only one instrument, i.e. The TREP. Have a look at the portfolio of the UTI’s overnight fund – Again, 100% of the fund invests in TREP only. This leads us to an important conclusion – as every overnight fund invests in TREP instrument, there is no difference between the overnight fund A and overnight Fund B. They all tend to put up the same performance. The only difference is because of the difference in the expense ratio. Zerodha.com/varsity\\nOf course, we have not discussed the expense ratio, yet in this module, we will in the coming chapter. So who would want to invest in an overnight fund? Well, this is an ideal fund for anyone looking at parking funds for a short term duration. By short term, I mean for less than three months. Remember, if you want to park funds for more than three months or 90 days, you are better off looking at a liquid fund. It is futile to look at the return aspect of an overnight fund. It does not make sense, because you don’t invest in an overnight fund to chase ‘returns’, you do for the sake of convenience. However, if you are interested, as of today, overnight funds yield around 4\\ue0885% annualized. So you can do the math on a pro-rata basis. 12.2 – Ultra-short duration Fund Next up is the ultra short term debt mutual fund. Things in the debt mutual fund start getting interesting from now. Think of yourself as a debt mutual fund manager. Your job as a fund manager is to find investments opportunities in the debt market. You can do so by investing the scheme’s corpus in new bond/CP issues, or you can choose to buy these bonds from the secondary bond market. Think of this as buying a stock at the IPO or buying it post the IPO from the stock exchanges. Now, the moment you buy it from the \\nsecondary market, the price of the bond will (may) differ from the first issue price. Why would the price vary? Well, for a host of reasons including the demand and supply dynamics of the bond. Each time a bond is purchased, the bond manager expects a periodic coupon (interest) payment during the tenure of the bond and at the end of the tenure, the principal to be repaid. Let us hold on to this thought for a moment. We will get back to this thread in a bit. Think of another case. Your best friend needs Rs.10,000/-. He approaches you for it and promises to repay within a year. You decide to give him this money, interest-free. Now, how long does it take for you to recover back your money? The time taken to get back your money is a year. It was easy to evaluate the time taken because there is no other cash flow in the form of interest repayment. On the other hand, if there was an additional cash flow in terms of a coupon payment, paid every three months, then what do you think would be the time taken to recover the money? While pinpointing to the exact number can be a bit tricky, intuition says that the time taken to recover the money is little lower than a full year, because there is cash flow. Do note; you can do some math and get the exact time to recover the money, but let’s not get there. Zerodha.com/varsity\\nThe point to note is – in the presence of cash flow, the time to recover the principal is lesser. With this point, let’s go back to the previous thread. Fund manager A subscribes to a bond at issuance. The specifications are as follows – Face value = Rs.1000 Coupon = 8% Coupon payment frequency = Semi-annual Maturity = 3 years Question – How long will the fund manager A take to recover the money invested in this bond? Answer – Intuition says that it could be a little lesser than three years. Fund manager B buys the same bond from the secondary market. Now, we know that the bond prices fluctuate in the market. Assume the fund manager B pays Rs.1020 for the same bond. Question – How long will the fund manager take to recover the money invested in this bond? Answer – Intuition says Fund manager B will take slightly higher time to recover the price paid for the bond when compared to fund manager A. Fund manager C buys the same bond from the secondary market. Assume the fund manager pays Rs.980 for the same bond. Zerodha.com/varsity\\nQuestion – How long will the fund manager take to recover the money invested in this bond? Answer – Intuition says Fund manager C will take lesser time to recover the price paid for the bond when compared to Fund manager A. I’m trying to make two points here – Bond price fluctuates Based on the price paid, the time to recover the invested amount varies. There is an exact science to estimate the time to recover, that is an integral part of the bond math. The metric, ‘time to recover’, is called ‘ Macaulay’s Duration of a Bond ’. Why is ‘Macaulay Duration’ essential and why are we discussing that? Well, have a look at how SEBI defines the characteristics of an ultra-short duration fund – According to this definition, an Ultra Short duration fund can invest in short maturity bills and CPs, which has a maturity between 3 month and six months (90 to 180 days) . Zerodha.com/varsity\\nAn important point to note here is that SEBI specifies this at a portfolio level and not restricted to an individual bill or CP. What this means is that the fund can buy CPs with a maturity of fewer than 90 days or maybe more than 180 days, they can even invest in TREPS, but at an overall portfolio level, the fund has to ensure that the Macaulay duration of the entire portfolio falls within 3 to 6 months. To give you a perspective, have a look at the portfolio of DSP’s Ultra-short duration fund – The bulk of the ultra-short duration fund is invested in money market instruments; the maturity ranges anywhere between 1 day to 365 days. Mostly these are CPs belonging to various corporate entities, here is a snapshot of their money market portfolio – They also hold NCDs and Bonds (NCDs and bonds are the same) , which have a maturity of at least a year – \\nThe job of the fund manager is to ensure that they not only manage the returns but also manage the Macaulay duration of the entire portfolio such that they adhere to the SEBI specified norm. There is another interesting point to note here – while the ratings of CPs kind of vary for the money market instruments, they are all triple-A for Bonds and NCDs. Triple AAA ratings imply that the probability of default is lower. As the maturity of the bond increases, the bond manager is more worried about possible default in the bond. Hence, they tend to stick AAA rate bonds. However, this leads us to a critical point concerning ultra-short duration funds – they are not risk-free. These funds too, have the risk of credit default and rating downgrade. Given this, who should invest in an ultra-short duration fund? I think that this is a good fund for anyone looking to park money for 1\\ue0882 years, plus they are ok to take a wee bit of risk on the parked capital. If you can make peace with the fact that on the downside your money can go down by a few percentage points, then go ahead and park your funds in this ultra short term funds. Zerodha.com/varsity\\nIf you are looking at parking money for lesser than a year, stick to a liquid fund instead. On the return side, I think it is reasonable to expect a return close to the bank’s fixed deposit. 12.3 – Franklin and Vodafone saga Since we are talking about Ultra-short duration bonds, I guess it makes sense to quickly discuss the Franklin – Vodafone drama that unfolded earlier this year. Franklin India had invested in Vodafone India Limited (VIL)’s debt papers across six different debt schemes, including its Ultra short-duration bond fund. In Oct 2019, the Supreme Court of India passed a judgement in favour of the Dept of Telecom (Dot) , in a case against DoT and the telecom operators. As a result of the Supreme Court’s judgement, the operators were asked to pay the licence fee and the spectrum usage charge based on the Adjusted Gross Revenue (AGR). If you are not familiar with this, then I’d suggest you read this short note from the good folks at Finshots, they have done a great job at explaining the AGR episode – https: //finshots.in/archive/the-final-verdict-on-agr-2/ Anyway, to cut a long story short, post this judgement, VIL was now expected to Rs.27,000 Crs to DoT towards unpaid dues. This means VIL would be cash squeezed; hence they are likely to default on their debt obligations. Zerodha.com/varsity\\nAs a smart money manager, after all, sorts of ramification of this judgement, Franklin India took a proactive step, and they themself internally downgraded the VIL’s papers to junk status and wrote off that investment. To give you a perspective, Franklin India’s Ultra-short bond fund had 4.2% of its portfolio invested in VIL’s paper. Now, what do you think happens when you 4.2% of your portfolio is rendered useless? Obviously, the NAV of the fund falls. Check this – In my view, Franklin may take at least a year or year and a half to get back to the previous NAV levels. The only reason I’m discussing the Franklin and Vodafone issue is to make you understand that debt funds too are risky, invest in them only after you fully understand the risk involved. Zerodha.com/varsity\\nI’ll stop this chapter at this stage. Before I wrap this up, I’d like to give you a quick insight into the direction we are heading with this module. So far, we have discussed Equity mutual and few debt funds. The discussion is restricted mainly to a brief introduction to these funds and what happens within these funds. In the next chapter, we will continue this and introduce a few other debt funds and probably wind up the introduction bit. Once we are through with that, we will start with the fund analysis bit and figure how to select mutual funds, both debt and equity and slowly steer our way in building a goal-based mutual fund portfolio. So, we have a long way to go. Stay tuned and stay safe! Key takeaways from this chapter ● Overnight funds invest in debt instruments with a 24hr settlement cycle ● Almost all overnight funds invest in Tri party repo ● The performance across overnight funds is similar ● Macaulay Duration of a fund gives us a sense of how long it takes for the fund to get back its invested amount ● Ultra-short duration fund has a Macaulay duration between 3 to 6 months ● Ultrashort duration funds are also risky \\n \\nCHAPTER  13 \\nThe Debt Funds (Part 3)  \\n13.1 – Debt jargons \\nAs we enter the 27th day of the nationwide lockdown, I hope you and your \\nloved ones are staying home, staying safe. The number of COVID19 cases in \\nIndia has crossed 17,000 with Maharashtra topping the charts with over 3,500 \\ncases. I hope all of this ends soon and we can all get back to our normal lives, \\nuntil then the only mantra is ‘social distancing’, I hope you are following this \\ndiligently. \\nI think many people across the country are using the lockdown opportunity \\nto learn something new and educated themselves. The traﬀic on Varsity has \\nshot up quite a bit, here is the pageview snapshot from Google Analytics –  \\nAlong with the pageview,  the number of queries pouring in has also shot up. \\nWe spend several hours every day to answer your questions. \\n  \\n\\n  \\nSo if you find the new chapter update a bit slow, then please do understand \\nits because of the increased load 🙂 In the previous chapter, we introduced a term called ‘Macaulay Duration’. If \\nyou recollect, Macaulay duration measure in years, the time required for the \\nbondholder to recover the price paid for the bond by the bond’s cash flow. We \\ndid not discuss the math behind Macaulay duration because that’s outside \\nthe scope, but as I hinted in the previous chapter, the next module is on fixed \\nincome security (mini-series) where I’ll try and take this up in detail. \\nHowever, while we cruise along, there are few bond relationships that you \\nneed to know – \\nThe yield of a bond and the price of the bond are inversely proportional. If the \\nprice of the bond increases, the yield of the bond decreases and vice versa \\n  \\n \\nInterest rates and bond price are inversely proportional. If the interest rates \\nincrease, the bond price reduces and vice versa. \\nWhile we are at it, let me introduce another term – ‘ Modified Duration’, of the \\nbond. \\nThe modified duration (measured in years) of a bond is essentially the \\nsensitivity of the bond’s price to the change in interest rate. So if a bond has a modified duration of 3.2 years, then – \\nA 1% increase in interest rate decreases the bond’s price by 3.2%. A 1.5% \\nincrease in the interest rate, lower the bond’s price by 4.8% \\nA 1% decrease in interest rate increases the bond’s price by 3.2%. A 1.5% \\ndecrease in bond price, increases the bond’s price by 4.8% \\nWe can generalize this – Higher duration funds have a higher sensitivity to \\ninterest rate changes. So a 1% change in interest rate reduced the price of a \\nlonger duration fund in a greater magnitude compared to a low duration fund \\nand vice versa. \\nIn the context of a mutual debt fund, the modified duration is at an aggregate \\nportfolio level. In the example above, say for a 1.5% increase in the interest rate, the debt fund’s NAV is likely to decrease by 4.8%. I hope you get the dri\\x00. \\nAs a debt mutual fund investor, you are in the right spot if you are aware of \\nthe few points we have discussed so far. Along with these few points, as a \\nbondholder or a debt mutual fund holder, you need to be aware that the \\nmutual fund you are holding is susceptible to – \\n  \\n \\nCredit risk – The risk that the bond held by the debt fund can get downgraded \\nDefault risk – The risk that the bond issuer defaults on a coupon or principal \\nrepayment \\nOf course, now you also know that the bond price has an interest rate risk, but at this point, let us just assume the fund manager can hedge the interest \\nrate risk. \\nAnyway, we will get back to the good old debt mutual funds. In this chapter, \\nwe will continue our discussion and take a few more debt (sub) categories. \\nWe will start the conversation with the low duration, money market, and \\nshort-duration funds. \\n13.2 – Low duration and Money Market \\nWe looked at the ultra-short duration bond fund in the previous chapter. The \\ndefining criterion for the ultra-short duration fund was the Macaulay duration \\nof the portfolio. As per SEBI’s classification, at the aggregate portfolio level, \\nthe Macaulay duration of the ultra short term duration fund has to vary \\nbetween three to six months. \\nNext up is the low duration fund. The low duration fund is just like the \\nultra-short duration, only that the low duration fund, the  Macaulay duration \\nat the aggregate portfolio level varies between six to twelve months. \\nThe credit risk of the low duration fund is similar to the ultra-short duration \\nfund. Hence it is imperative for the investors to glance through the asset \\nquality (paper quality) of the fund. \\n  \\n \\nHave a look at the portfolio of the IDFC AMC’s low duration fund –  \\nAs you can see, IDFC has 100% of its portfolio invested across various AAA \\npapers. However, just because the fund has only AAA papers, does not imply \\nzero credit risk. Remember, we discussed the Vodafone case in the previous \\nchapter. \\nWhile the credit risk exists, the interest rate risk for the low duration fund is \\nlow. Have a look at the modified duration of IDFC’s Low duration fund \\n(published in the fund’s factsheet) –  \\nThe modified duration is 289 days. I can convert this to years by dividing this \\nby 360 – \\n= 289/360 \\n  \\n \\n= 0.802 \\nThis means to say for every 1% increase or decrease in the interest rate, and \\nthe NAV is likely to decrease/increase by 0.802%, which as you can imagine is \\nnot much. \\nBy the way, not all funds report modified duration in terms of the number of \\ndays. Modified duration is expressed in terms of years. \\nFor example, the Nippon India low duration fund expresses the modified \\nduration in years, which is 0.94 yrs.  \\n  \\n \\nSo when the fund expresses in years, you need not divide by 360. Instead, you \\ncan use the number directly. \\nWhile we are at it, which of the two low duration funds do you think is risky in \\nterms of modified duration? \\nIDFC’s Low duration Fund with a modified duration of 0.802 or Nippon India’s \\nlow duration fund with a modified duration of 0.94? \\nHere is a task for you – why do you think Nippon India’s low duration fund has \\na higher modified duration? Can you look into their portfolio (as of April 2020) \\nand get your answer? \\nIf you can answer these questions with ease, then we are headed on the right \\ntrack 🙂 Lastly, who should look at investing in a low duration fund? This is best suited \\nunder situations where you want to park your money for a short duration and \\nutilize the funds towards a specific goal at a later point. \\nNext up is the money market fund. \\nThe money market fund is somewhat similar to the low duration fund. Here is \\nSEBI’s classification of the money market fund –  \\nAs you can see, the maturity is capped to one year, similar to that of low \\nduration fund; the only diﬀerence is in terms of the portfolio constituents. \\n  \\n \\nA low duration fund can invest in both money market instruments and bonds \\nbut ensure at the aggregate portfolio level the duration is between 6-12 \\nmonths. The money market fund, however, can invest only in money market \\ninstruments. The money market instruments usually consist – \\n‘Commercial Papers’ or CPs, issued by companies. CPs are unsecured \\n‘Certificate of Deposits’ or CDs. Banks issue CDs to entities depositing money \\nT-Bills, issued by the Government, carries a sovereign guarantee. \\nSo just to summarize, the fund manager of a low duration fund can invest in \\nCPs, CDs, and perhaps even in a bond with two years maturity. However, a \\nmoney market fund manager can only invest in CDs and CPs. \\nLet me ask you two question – \\nWhat is the risk of investing in a money market fund? \\nWhat do you think will be the modified duration of a money market fund? Will \\nit be 1, greater than one or less than 1. \\nDo pause here, think about it, try to answer yourself. \\nHave a look at the factsheet of UTI’s Money market fund – \\n  \\n  \\nYou will find the answers for both the questions here. \\nThe money market fund is exposed to credit risk. As you can see, 9.39% of the \\nportfolio is invested in a single company’s CP or CD. Of course, the company’s \\npaper enjoys a high rating, but I want you to remember the fact that these \\nratings can change. So yeah, credit risk exists in a money market fund. \\nAs you may have guessed, the modified duration will be under one year for a \\nmoney market fund, which implies that the interest rate risk for these funds is \\nlow. \\nInvestment philosophy in the money market fund is similar to the low \\nduration fund. In fact, many investors o\\x00en choose between low duration and \\nthe money market fund. \\n  \\n \\n13.3 – Short Duration and Medium Duration funds \\nNext up is the short duration fund. Let’s start straight with SEBI’s definition –  \\nThe Macaulay’s duration of the short duration fund has to range between 1 \\nand 3 years. A\\x00er reading the SEBI definition, what is the first thing that \\ncomes to your mind? \\nWell, I hope you think about it from a risk perspective. With an increase in the duration, the modified duration also increases – which means the risk \\nassociated with changes in interest rate is higher with a short duration fund \\n(and the medium duration fund).  Do note; this was not so much of a concern \\nwith the low duration and money market fund (or even the ultra-short \\nduration fund). \\nOf course, credit risk continues for short duration fund as well. Have a look at \\nthe rating profile of the Mirae Asset Short Term Fund – \\n  \\n  \\nAs you can see, the fund has a mix of AAA, AA and A1+ debt papers in the \\nportfolio. For the same fund, look at the modified duration –  \\nThe modified duration is 2.67 years, which means, for every 1% increase in \\nthe interest rate, the fund will drop 2.67% in its NAV. The risk associated with \\nthe short-term fund is higher compared to all the other funds we have \\ndiscussed so far. \\nAlso, do notice the Macaulay duration of the fund, it is below 3, as SEBI has \\ndefined. \\nWith a considerable amount of risk, you need to be clear with your \\ninvestment objective in these funds. Invest in these funds only if you have an \\n  \\n \\ninvestment horizon of at least three years in perspective. Of course, with the \\nincreased risk, the return expectation is also higher. I think it is prudent to \\nexpect about 7 (ish) % return on these short-duration funds. \\nI think by now, you must have got the hang of how to understand the basics \\nof debt fund. \\nHere is the SEBI’s classification of a Medium duration fund –  \\nAs a task, why don’t you do look upon a fact sheet belonging to a medium \\nduration fund and answer these question – \\nHow is the portfolio composition? What do they hold in the portfolio? How \\nare the papers rated? \\nWhat do you this is the credit risk here? \\nWhat is the Macaulay duration? Does it match SEBI’s mandate? \\nWhat is the modified duration? What do you think is the risk associated with \\nthe interest rate change? \\nWhat is your investment horizon if you were to invest in these funds? \\n  \\n \\nI’m reasonably sure that you can carry out the above task with ease. If you \\nfind any diﬀiculty of any sort, then please do leave a query at the end of this \\nchapter and I’ll be more than happy to help you with it. \\nIn the next chapter, we will take up the Credit risk, dynamic bonds and the \\ngilts. However, there is one last thing we need to discuss before we end this \\nchapter. \\n13.4 – The  Franklin India debt fund saga \\nOn 23rd April 2020, Franklin Templeton (India) AMC made an announcement \\nthat shook the entire debt fund world. \\n  \\n  \\nIn an unprecedented move, Franklin has decided to close six of its debt funds, \\nwhich includes their low duration fund and ultra-short duration fund. The \\nAUM across these six funds is roughly Rs.27,000 Crores. \\nThe reason they cite is – because of the current economic situation, there is a \\nsurge in redemption, leading to a liquidity crunch within the AMC. \\n  \\n \\nTo put this in perspective, Franklin witnessed a surge in redemption to the \\nextent of over Rs.9000 Crores in March 2020, which as you can imagine is \\none-third of the AUM across these funds. \\nUnfortunately, the secondary bond market in India is not liquid enough. It is \\nnot easy for the fund managers to quickly liquidate the bonds from their \\nportfolio. For this reason, most of the bonds held to maturity. Of course, the \\nAMC plans to have enough cash to meet daily redemptions, they do this in \\nseveral ways, including a technique called laddering, wherein they have a \\nblend of papers maturing in diﬀerent timelines. The liquidity arrangements \\nwork when business functions as usual. But as we clearly understand now, \\nthings go helter-skelter when tables turn. \\nNone of the AMCs would be (at least up until now) prepared for such a steep \\nsurge in redemption. \\nHence to ease the situation, Franklin has decided to close down the schemes \\ncompletely and lockdown the funds entirely, which implies that if you are an \\ninvestor in these funds, then you cannot place a redemption request. \\nPlease note, the AMC is not winding down the scheme because of the credit \\nor interest rate risk. Folks at Franklin are outstanding in the debt fund game, \\nand they have vast experience in this segment, but unfortunately, they are \\nnow threading on a diﬀerent territory. \\nTherefore, dear readers, when investing in debt funds, along with the credit \\nand interest rate risk, factor in a new risk – liquidity risk. \\n  \\n \\nBut of course, how do you quantify and apply liquidity risk in a real-life \\nscenario? Well, I don’t know that just yet. However, does this mean that you \\nshould completely stay away from debt funds? \\nNo, not at all. \\nDebt funds play an essential role in asset allocation, and it should play its \\npart in your portfolio. The COVID19 situation, if not for anything, has yet again \\nhighlighted the importance of asset allocation. \\nMore on this as we cruise through this module! \\nStay home, stay safe! \\nKey takeaways from this chapter \\n● Bond yields and bond prices are inversely proportional \\n● Interest rate and bond prices are inversely proportional \\n● Modified duration helps us understand the change in NAV of \\nthe fund (in the context of debt fund) for every 1% change in \\ninterest rate \\n● Low duration fund has credit risk, but low-interest rate risk \\n● Money market fund has credit risk, but low interest rate risk \\n● Short and medium duration fund has both credit and interest \\nrate risk \\n● Debt investors have to factor in liquidity risk along with credit \\nand interest rate risk \\n  \\n \\nCHAPTER  14 \\nThe Debt Funds (Part 4) \\n14.1 – Liquidity Risk \\nIn the previous chapter, we discussed the Franklin debt fund saga. Thanks to \\nthis episode, as investors, we now very clearly know that investing in debt \\nfund should not be based on useless parameters such as the past returns or \\nthe current fund ranking. The market has taught us one two many times that \\nthis approach to fund selection is a pointless aﬀair. \\nThe evaluation must be based on risk metrics. Unless the investor develops a \\nsense of all the risk involved while investing in a debt fund, he or she should \\nnot even venture into the debt fund arena.  The same holds for equity funds \\nas well. However, thanks to the tagline ‘Mutual funds are subjected to market \\nrisk’, investors somehow perceive market risk as a risk associated (only) with \\nequity funds. Still, at least they are aware of the fact that equity funds are \\nrisky. \\nUnfortunately, the same set of people assume that the debt funds do not \\ncarry any risk. \\nIf you have read the previous chapters, you know that debt funds are risky \\ntoo, and you are even familiar with the risk types associated with debt funds, \\ni.e. default risk, credit risk, and the interest rate risk. The recent Franklin \\nepisode formally introduced us to another dormant risk factor called the \\n‘Liquidity Risk’. \\n  \\n\\n  \\nWe will start this chapter with a quick discussion on liquidity risk and then \\nproceed to learn the other categories (sub) of debt funds. \\nLiquidity risk, from the debt fund perspective, can mean two things – \\n● The lack of liquidity in the underlying market the debt funds invests in, \\ni.e. the Indian bond markets. \\n● The lack of availability of funds with the AMCs to service investor’s \\nredemption \\nBoth these are tightly related though. \\nThe lack of liquidity in the bond market implies that the AMCs cannot quickly \\nliquidate the papers they hold in the bond market, which means to say that \\nthey are obligated to keep the paper to maturity, which further implies that \\nthe money is kind of ‘locked-in’. \\n  \\n \\nNow the primary job of an AMC is to collect money from an investor, invest \\nthat money on their behalf, generate returns for the investors, and return the \\nfunds when the investor redeems the units. \\nTo honour the investor’s redemption, the AMC must hold enough cash across \\neach of the schemes. If the AMC does not have enough funds, then they \\ncannot service the redemption requests that come in, especially in case the \\nredemption requests come in large numbers. \\nThink about it for a second – on the one hand; the AMC has invested in debt \\npapers which it cannot sell as and when they wish (lack of liquidity in bonds \\nmarket) and on the other hand, it has to maintain a cash pile to service \\nredemptions. In the event redemption comes in large numbers, the lack of \\ncash causes a liquidity crisis. \\nFranklin India faced this same situation. One a day to day basis, AMCs \\nmaintain enough cash to service redemptions, a\\x00er all, redemptions are a \\nregular aﬀair for an AMCs. \\nHowever, if there is a surge in redemption, then the AMC will need extra cash \\nto service the redemption. Question is where they will get this money? \\nYou guessed it right, they borrow. \\nUnder SEBI’s guidelines, an AMC can borrow up to 20% of its net asset under \\nmanagement (AUM). You can read the detailed directions  here  – Here is the extract on AMC’s borrowing limits – \\n  \\n  \\nSo, if an AMC is pulling this lever to borrow funds, then it probably indicates \\nthat the AMC’s usual cash pile is depleting; hence they need to borrow more \\nto service redemption request. \\nHow do we get to know if the AMC  is borrowing? Well, one needs to look at \\nthe monthly portfolio declaration that the AMC makes. If the cash component \\nis positive, that means to say that the AMC is not borrowing funds, if it is \\nnegative, then that shows the presence of debt. \\nTake a look at Franklin’s Ultra-short Term fund’s portfolio from Jan 2020 –  \\nPortfolio in Feb 2020 –  \\nPortfolio in March 2020 – \\n  \\n  \\nAs you can see, the cash component turned negative in March 2020, which \\nmeans to say that the AMC had borrowed funds, showing some early signs of \\nliquidity stress. Franklin folded this particular fund along with five others on \\n23rd April 2020. So there was some warning on the wall. \\nThere are a couple of things to note here – \\n● Just because you see a negative cash value, do not jump into the \\nconclusion that the fund is about to go bust. Develop a sense to \\nconnect the dots to understand what is happening. \\n● The negative cash component can be a lagging indicator – remember \\nthe AMC’s portfolio details comes out with a delay; nevertheless, this is \\nstill a good indicator of trouble. \\nSo if you are a ‘do it yourself’ investor, then do keep an eye on this every \\nmonth. The onus is on you to figure the development in the market and \\nconnect these dots.  What do I mean by ‘connect the dots’? Could I connect \\nthe dots and developed a foresight into what would happen to Franklin in \\nMarch itself? \\nThese are tough questions to answer. Today, I have the benefit of hindsight, \\nand therefore I can lay down a list of things – \\n● Franklin’s Vodafone episode was the first warning sign. \\n  \\n \\n● The individual portfolios consisted of papers below AA+; this was \\nalways questionable. \\n● Cash decreased, borrowings increased. \\n● The market itself was weak, thanks to COVID 19 \\n● The street sentiment was negative. \\nWhen you connect these things, you’d somehow see trouble brewing. I \\nunderstand it may not be straightforward for a regular investor (or for that \\nmatter even seasoned analysts), with more market experience the ‘connect \\nthe dots’ bit becomes more intuitive and the call will eventually come from \\nyour gut 🙂 We will discuss more on this and other aspects of risk in the ‘how to select \\nmutual funds’, chapter. We will now proceed to understand three diﬀerent \\ntypes of debt funds – Banking & PSU Debt Funds, Credit risk funds, and the \\nGilts. \\n14.2 – Banking and PSU Debt Fund \\nIdeally, I’d have stopped discussing debt funds right a\\x00er the medium \\nduration funds, because in my opinion, all the other types of debt funds are \\nentirely pointless for a typical retail portfolio. \\nHowever, I think it is important to discuss other debt fund types to let you \\nknow what they are and what to expect. \\nLet us kick start this discussion with the  Banking & PSU Debt Funds. \\n  \\n \\nBefore we proceed, think about this a bit and try to imagine what the \\n‘Banking and PSU debt Fund’, really means. \\nIf you are someone like me, I’m sure you’d have thought that the Banking and \\nPSU debt Fund, as the name suggests is a fund that invests in papers from the \\nbanking and PSU sector. The banking and PSU sector is as one of the safest in \\nIndia. \\nFair enough now let’s see what SEBI has to say –  \\nWell, it looks like we were almost right 🙂 The fund invests in banking and PSU debt to the extent of 80%. Pay attention \\nto the 80% part here! \\nThe remaining 20% gets invested in any paper. \\nSuddenly what seemed like a harmless debt fund turns out tricky. \\nThis is an 80-20 cocktail, and there is a problem with it. Think about this from \\na regular retail investor, when he reads the fund’s title; it is only natural for \\nhim to expect the fund to be 100% Banking and PSU debt, he would not \\nexpect the fund to have papers from the private sector. \\nIf a default occurs in any of the paper from the 20% bucket, then the fund’s \\nNAV takes a hit. Who is to blame here? The investor for expecting a pure-play \\nBanking & PSU fund, the fund manager for lousy investment, or SEBI for \\npermitting this cocktail? \\n  \\n \\nHave a look at IDFC AMCs Banking & PSU Debt Fund –  \\nThe portfolio consists of paper from Reliance Industries to the extent of \\n1.27%, not that Reliance is terrible, could be a fantastic paper to hold. Still, \\nthe question is, does it belong here?   Anyway, the good part of the Banking and PUS Debt fund is that the credit \\nrisk is kind of on the lower side, mainly for two reasons – \\n● RBI provides liquidity support to banks and NBFCs \\n● Implicit Sovereign guarantee by the Govt of India for PSUs \\nBut remember, the ‘credit risk comfort’ is for 80% of the portfolio; the same is \\nnot valid for the balance of 20% of the portfolio. \\n  \\n \\nAlso, if you notice, SEBI has no specs on the Macaulay’s duration of the \\nportfolio, which means the fund manager is flexible with the duration of the \\npapers held in the portfolio. Given this, the modified duration will be on the \\nhigher side for these funds. \\nHere are the parameters for the IDFC’s Banking & PSU Debt fund –  \\nThe average duration is about 3.1 years, which is in line with any mid duration \\nfund. The modified duration is about 2.6, which for a debt fund is on the \\nslightly higher end of the spectrum. If the interest rate goes up, the fund will \\ntake quite a bit of time to recover from the fallen NAV. \\nGiven this, an investor looking at investing in these debt funds should have at \\nleast 3-5 years perspective while investing in the Banking & PSU Debt fund. \\nAt this point, I think it is important to remind the readers that so far in this \\nmodule, we are only introducing diﬀerent types of fund. We have made few \\npassing comments on some of these categories, but we still haven’t figured \\nhow and why one should invest if at all one has to. \\nAt a later point in this module, we will try and figure two significant bits – \\n● How to analyse a Mutual Fund? \\n● How to build an MF portfolio? \\nWhen we do this discussion, we will tie all loose ends and develop a holistic \\napproach to personal finance. \\n  \\n \\n14.3 – Credit Risk Funds \\nBefore October 2017 (before SEBI’s huge MF reclassification circular), Credit \\nRisk Funds were called ‘Credit Opportunities Fund’. \\nDo you notice the change in perception here? \\nCredit Opportunity Fund – the emphasis is on the opportunity, returns, and \\ngenerally has a positive feel to it, hence easier to sell 🙂 Credit Risk Fund – It’s the same fund, but by highlighting the term risk, the \\nemphasis is on the risk, and rightly so. \\nAnyway, the name ‘Credit risk fund’, should give you a heads up on what to \\nexpect in this fund 🙂 Yes, you guessed it right, the fund is loaded with Credit Risk! \\nAs usual, let us start with SEBI’s definition –  \\nAnd if you are wondering what the little circumflex next to the name points to \\n–  \\nSEBI here simply specifies that an AMC running a credit risk fund should \\ninvest 65% of the assets in corporate bonds, which are ‘below are below the \\ninvestment grade, which means – \\n  \\n \\n● These bonds carry maximum credit risk, hence the probability of both, \\ndefault by the bond issuer and credit downgrade is very high \\n● No spec on where the balance 35% gets invested \\nThe Credit risk fund is where the fund managers cut themselves to chase \\nyields. Think of it like a hungry kid at a buﬀet dinner party. The plate will be \\nloaded, with zero control on what gets packed in the plate. \\nSimilarly, a fund manager running a credit risk fund loads up the portfolio \\nwith risky papers to chase yields. Let me explain this. \\nThe objective of a credit risk fund is to take on as much credit risk as possible \\nto ensure a higher yield to the investors. What does this mean? \\nThis means the fund will lend the investor’s funds to corporates whose \\nrepayment track record or repayment capability is questionable. Why would \\nthe fund manager deliberately lend to a corporate who is unlikely to repay? \\nHe does so because the corporates in need of the fund say, ‘give me the \\nmoney, and I’ll compensate you with higher interest rates’. \\nYou see the point, right? Corporate with bad credit history has to entice new \\nlender by paying a higher coupon rate. \\nThe debt papers of such corporates usually have a lower rating. When the \\nfund manager lends to such entities, he hopes for the following – \\n● The borrowing entity will repay and honour the interest paid regularly. \\n● He also hopes the corporate entity improves its creditworthiness. \\n  \\n \\n● If the creditworthiness improves, then the rating of the bond/paper will \\nimprove. \\n● If the ratings improve, the bond price goes up, hence the NAV increases \\nIf these things were to happen, not only will the fund manager get higher \\ninterest rates for the money he has lent, but will benefit from the credit rating \\nupgrade and the eventual increase in bond prices. \\nLet us look at a portfolio of a Credit Risk Fund; this belongs to DSP’s Credit \\nRisk fund –  \\nThe fund manager here has decided to allocate nearly 30% of its assets to just \\none company. You can imagine the hit on the NAV of this fund if this company \\nwere to default on its obligation. \\nThe credit ratings of the other companies are not excellent either; well, this is \\nexpected from a credit risk fund. Still, the combination of concentrated \\npositions coupled with lousy credit ratings makes this a hazardous category \\nto invest. \\n  \\n \\nThe credit risk fund is a complicated category to understand, but the good \\npart is that a retail investor does not need to endure this pain. \\nAlmost all portfolio goals of a retail investor can be achieved without  GILTS in \\nthe portfolio. So do avoid investing your money in a credit risk fund. \\n14.4 – GILT Funds \\nBack in the early 19th Century, when the Government would borrow money, \\nthey would do so by issuing a bond (a physical paper), on which the terms of \\nthe borrowing were written and signed. The edges of such a bond were laced \\nin Gold, to showcase the sanctity of Government borrowing. Such bonds \\nissued by the Government were called the ‘Gilt-edged bonds’, because of \\ngolden edges. \\nThe presence of Gold does not eliminate the credit or interest rate risk, at the \\nend of the day, this technically is still a bond 🙂 However, the fact that the borrower is the Government implies that there is \\nvirtually zero Credit risk, because, well, the Government cannot default on \\ndebt obligations. \\nThe legacy continues, and even today, the bonds issued by the Government is \\ncalled a GILT, there is no gold lacing today, but the Sovereign Guarantee still \\nexists. \\nNow, as you can imagine, a mutual fund that invests predominantly in \\nGovernment bonds or Gilts is called a ‘Gilt Fund’. \\nHere is SEBI’s definition of a GILT fund – \\n  \\n  \\nThere are two types of GILT funds – \\n● Gilt funds – Invests a minimum of 80% of its assets in Government \\nsecurities. This implies 20% can go anywhere (again the cocktail \\nproblem) \\n● Gilt with ten-year constant duration – This fund is the same as above \\nwith the added clause that the Macaulay’s duration is at least ten years. \\nBy defining the duration, the entire risk profile of this fund changes. \\nAgreed, there is no Credit risk for the investor here. We expect the \\nGovernment never to default. But think about the interest rate risk in these \\nfunds, especially the constant duration one. As you can imagine the interest \\nrate risk is quite significant in these funds,  probably large enough to \\ncompensates for the absence of credit risk. \\nI would urge you to look into the fact sheet of any GILT fund and observe the \\nduration and modified duration to get a sense of how risky these funds are. \\nIf you ever decide to invest in these funds, then do so only with a long, really \\nlong term perspective. I’m talking about 8-10 year time frame here. \\nI really don’t see a need for a GILT  fund in any retail portfolio; you are better \\nwithout this. \\n  \\n \\nAnyway, with this, we will wrap up our discussion on debt funds. Up next is \\nETFs and Index funds. \\nKey takeaways from this chapter \\n● A debt fund investor should watch out for liquidity risk \\n● The cash borrowings of a fund is an indicator of liquidity risk \\n● The Banking and PSU debt funds invest predominantly in \\nbanking/financial services, and PSU debt \\n● The banking and PSU debt carries less credit risk (relatively) \\ncompared to its peers \\n● Credit risk fund carries a high degree of credit risk. A retail \\ninvestor is better oﬀ avoiding this fund \\n● GILTS don’t have credit risk but have a significant amount of \\ninterest rate risk        \\n  \\n \\nCHAPTER  15 \\nInvesting in Bonds  \\n15.1 – Context \\nI understand we concluded the previous chapter by hinting that we would \\ndiscuss Index funds next. However, I’m taking a bit of a detour to introduce \\nhow one can invest in Bonds directly. \\nWhy am ‘I doing this now? Well, that is because we have just discussed debts \\nfunds and the associated terms, given the similarity between debt funds and \\nbonds, I thought we could extend that discussion and talk about bonds as \\nwell. \\nBesides, Zerodha’s bond investing platform is up and ready for you to use, so \\nthis chapter will help you understand how to use the platform as well.  \\n  \\n\\n \\nRemember, when you invest in any sort of debt mutual fund, you primarily \\ninvest in a mutual fund whose fund manager invests your funds in various \\nbonds and bills. Using Zerodha’s platform, you can now directly invest in the \\nbonds, just like the fund manager would. \\n15.2 – The bonds platform \\nThe bonds platform on Zerodha is a part of Coin, our mutual fund platform.  \\nOn the landing page, you can see that we are talking about high-quality PSU \\nand Corporate Bonds. High quality here means the highest credit ratings. \\nAt any given point, the platform lists all the available bonds for you to invest. \\nAs of today, these are the bonds available to you – \\n  \\n  \\nFor example, the very first is a bond from Rural Electrification Corporation \\nLimited (REC).  \\nThere are two tags below the company’s name; these tags give you vital \\ninformation on the bonds. \\n● PSU Tax-free  – Remember, PSUs carry an implicit Sovereign guarantee; hence the credit risk in these PSU bonds is very low. The tax-free bit \\nindicates that the interest income received from these bonds is 100% \\ntax-exempt. The tax-free bit makes these bonds extremely attractive for \\nthe investors. However, the tax-free is applicable only for the interest \\nincome. If you hold the bond till maturity, there will be no taxation on \\n  \\n \\nyour interest earnings from this bond. However, if you manage to sell \\nthis bond before maturity at a price more than what you had \\npurchased, then you get capital gains which are taxable. \\n● Credit Rating  – REC Limited’s bond is rated triple-A (AAA) by CRISIL; the \\nrating is an indication of the creditworthiness of the borrower. AAA is \\nthe highest-ranking, so one need not worry about the creditworthiness \\nof the borrower, i.e. REC in this case. \\nApart from these tags, there are other specs available to you. Some of these \\nare easy and intuitive, while the others are not.  \\nOn the platform, you can see a summarized view of the most important \\nparameters for you to consider before investing. A typical investor does not \\nneed any more information apart from what’s listed above. \\nHowever, for the sake of this chapter and its completeness,  let’s dig into \\nmore details of this particular REC bond. The ISIN of this bond is \\nINE020B07HO1, key in the  ISIN here  and you’ll get all the other information \\nrelated to this bond. \\nI’ve highlighted the most significant bits here – \\n  \\n  \\nLet’s start with the first item from the le\\x00. As we can see, this is a  secured \\ndebt . A secured debt is a loan backed by security. The classic example is a \\nGold loan. \\nIn a gold loan, you pledge the gold and raise a loan against it. When you repay \\nthe loan, the pledge on gold goes away, and you get back the gold. In case \\nyou don’t repay the loan, the lender is free to take your gold and make good \\nfor his loss. \\nGiven this, if you look at it from the lender’s perspective, a secured debt gives \\nthe lender a higher comfort compared to unsecured debt. \\nIn the next section, you can see that this is  senior  debt. \\nEvery company has something called ‘Capital Structure’. The capital structure \\nis like a leader board of sorts, which mandates the list of stakeholders who \\nhave the highest claim on the company’s repayment and earning structure. \\nThe senior secured debt sits right at the top of a capital structure, while a \\ncommon stock (equities) sits right at last. Between the senior debt and \\n  \\n \\nequity, lie other stakeholders like the unsecured debt, convertible bonds, \\nnon-convertible debt etc. In case of liquidation of the company (worst case \\nscenario), the senior debt holders are the first ones to be paid oﬀ from the \\nliquidation amount of the company. This significantly enhances the safety of \\ncapital for senior debt holders. \\nSo the moment you see secured senior debt, be assured that the credit risk \\nassociated is relatively very low. \\nThe section a\\x00er this is quite self-explanatory, talks about the date of issue. \\nThink about this as the company’s IPO date or an NFO debuting in the MF \\nmarket. \\nREC paper was issued in 2013, maturing in 2023, making this a 10-year bond. \\nNow move your attention to the details mentioned on the right — the \\ntopmost section details out a few essential parameters. \\nFirstly, the face value, which is Rs.1000/-. The face value of a bond is essential \\nfor three reasons – \\n1. Gives you a sense of the premium or discount the bond is trading to its \\nface value. In the case of REC (refer to the snapshot from COIN), the \\ncurrent price for this bond is Rs.1115.03/-, which is at a premium to face \\nvalue. 2. The coupon is paid as a percentage of the face value. The coupon for \\nthis bond is 8.01%, which means that every bond you hold gives you \\nRs.80.01/- as interest income until it matures. \\n3. Upon maturity, the redemption value depends on the bond’s face \\nvalue. More on this later. \\n  \\n \\nThe next section highlights the interest payment details. As highlighted, the \\nREC bond pays the interest on 1st Dec every year, till the bond matures. The \\ncompany pays out interest annually. Some bonds pay interest semiannually, \\nquarterly, and some even pay monthly. \\nYou can also see the maturity date, which is 24th September 2023. \\nNow that you know these details, I’d suggest you re-look at the COIN \\nsnapshot. Everything mentioned in the snapshot should be clear, except for \\nthe YTM.  15.3 – Yield to Maturity \\nThe concept of ‘Yield to Maturity’ or YTM is one of the most important \\nconcepts to understand when dealing with bonds. While the bond’s coupon is \\nessential, as an investor in bonds, you need to be more concerned about the YTM than the coupon itself. \\nI think the concept of YTM is best understood if we look at it from transactions \\nwe are familiar with. Given this, let us build a hypothetical situation around \\nthis. \\nScenario 1 \\nYour friend informs you about a fantastic commercial property, capable of \\ngiving you a 20% rental yield on the investment. \\nRental yield = Total rent collected in the year / Amount invested in the property. \\n  \\n \\nYou get all excited, because, from your research, the average commercial \\nrental yield is about 15%, so the deal your friend proposed stands out. You \\nask your friend for more information. \\nHe tells that the fair price for the commercial property is 3 Crores. You do not \\nbat an eyelid; you pay 3 Crore cash down and buy the property. \\nFrom the next month, you start receiving a rent of Rs.500,000/- into your \\naccount. \\nTwelve months pass by, and rental income is flowing smoothly. \\nHowever, at the end of 12 months, you have a premonition that a virus will hit \\nthe world, people will start working from home, and therefore the \\ncommercial real estate will lose its sheen. \\nYou decide to sell the property and cash out. Assume the property market \\nstayed flat; hence, you get to sell the property at cost, i.e. 3 Crore. \\nThe question is, how much did you make on this entire transaction? In other \\nwords, what was your Net Yield? For the sake of simplicity, forget about taxes \\nand charges. \\nThis is a straightforward calculation – \\nBuy Price = 3 Crore \\nSell Price = 3 Crore \\nP&L on Property = 0  ———- (1) \\nRental per month = Rs.500,000/- \\n  \\n \\nNumber of months rent collected = 12 \\nTotal Rental income = 12 * 500,000 = Rs.60,00,000/-  ————– (2) \\nNet P&L =  (1) + (2) \\n= Rs.60,00,000/- \\nNet Yield = Net P&L / Buy price \\n= 60 Lakh / 3 Crore \\n= 20% \\nThe net yield equals the rental yield. \\nScenario 2 \\nEverything remains the same, except that at the time of buying, instead of 3 \\nCrore, you bought the property at 3.3 Crore. What is the net yield? \\nBuy Price = 3.3 Crore \\nSell Price = 3 Crore \\nP&L on Property = A loss of 30 Lakh  ———- (1) \\nRental per month = Rs.500,000/- \\nNumber of months rent collected = 12 \\nTotal Rental income = 12 * 500,000 = Rs.60,00,000/-  ————– (2) \\nNet P&L =  (1) + (2) \\n= Rs.30,00,000/- \\n  \\n \\nNet Yield = Net P&L / Buy price \\n= 30 Lakh / 3.3 Crore \\n= 9.09% \\nNotice, everything remained the same, except for the buy price. However, this \\nhad a big impact on the net yield.  Scenario 3 \\nEverything remains the same, except that at the time of buying, instead of 3 \\nCrore, you bought the property at 2.9 Crore. What is the net yield? \\nBuy Price = 2.9 Crore \\nSell Price = 3 Crore \\nP&L on Property = +10 Lakh  ———- (1) \\nRental per month = Rs.500,000/- \\nNumber of months rent collected = 12 \\nTotal Rental income = 12 * 500,000 = Rs.60,00,000/-  ————– (2) \\nNet P&L =  (1) + (2) \\n= Rs.70,00,000/- \\nNet Yield = Net P&L / Buy price \\n= 70 Lakh / 3 Crore \\n= 24.14% \\n  \\n \\nNotice, in all the three scenarios, the rental yield was fixed at 20% that dint \\nchange at all. But the net yield changed, based on the transaction prices. \\nIn summary – \\n● The rental yield and the net yield matches only when the buy and sell \\nremains the same \\n● The net yield is lesser than the rental yield when the buy price is higher \\nthan the selling price \\n● The net yield is higher than the rental yield when the buy price is lower \\nthan the selling price. \\nThe point that I’m trying to make here is that net yield is very diﬀerent from \\nthe rental yield. \\nNow, let us snap back to the bonds world and make few comparisons – \\nBuy price of the property = Buy price of the bond \\nSell price of the property = Sell price of the bond \\nRental yield = Coupon \\nNet yield = Yield to maturity or YTM. \\nLook at this again –  \\nThe coupon is 8.01%, but the YTM is 5.4%. Why do you think the YTM is lesser \\nthan the coupon itself? \\n  \\n \\nWell, that is because you buy this bond at Rs.1115.03/- and upon maturity, \\nthis bond is redeemed at Rs.1000/- (scenario 2). \\nSo the eﬀective return you experience here is 5.4%. \\n15.4 – Accrued Interest \\nClicking on the yellow invest button takes you to the next screen on the \\nplatform, which gives you a bit more information on the bond.  \\nI suppose you are familiar with most of the information present on this \\nscreen, except for the accrued interest bit. The concept of accrued interest is \\nstraightforward to understand. \\nWe know the REC bond pays a coupon of 8.01% on Rs.1000/- face value. The \\nRupee value of the coupon is Rs.80.01/-. \\nThe coupon of Rs.80.01/- gets paid once a year or once in 365 days. We know \\nthe date of payment is the 1st December every year. \\nThe last coupon was paid on 1st December 2019, and the next coupon will be \\npaid on 1st December 2020. Between the previous coupon paid and the next \\ncoupon date, interest accrues daily. \\n  \\n \\nIf you do the math – \\nDaily accrued interest = Yearly coupon amount / 365 \\n= 80.01/365 \\n= 0.219452 Paisa. \\nTherefore, by holding this bond, the bondholder earns 0.219452 daily. \\nToday is 21st May 2020; it is 172 days since the last coupon paid. Therefore, by \\nholding this bond for 172 days, the owner of this bond is entitled to receive – \\n0.219452 * 172 \\n=  Rs.37.745/- \\nFrom the screenshot above, you can see that the accrued interest is \\nRs.37.86/-, which is approximate to what we have calculated. \\nThe settlement price seen is Rs.1115.47/-, which also includes the accrued \\ninterest. Therefore, you can break the settlement price into two components \\n– \\nSettlement Price = Price of the Bond + Accrued Interest \\n= 1077.609 + 37.8615 \\n= 1115.47/- \\nSo why does the settlement price include the accrued interest? \\nWell, this is because when you buy the bond, you need to compensate the \\nbond seller the interest he has earned for the duration he has held the bond. \\n  \\n \\nHence, the settlement price includes accrued interest. Also note that when \\nthe next coupon is paid by REC, you as the current bondholder will receive \\nthe full coupon amount of Rs.80.01/- (thus compensating for the accrued \\ninterest that you paid to the seller). \\nWhile we are at it, a bit of bond terminology for you. \\nThe settlement price is also called the ‘ Dirty Price ’ of the bond and the \\nsettlement price minus the accrued interest is called the ‘ Clean price ’ of the \\nbond \\n15.5 – Should you invest in Bonds? \\nIf you’ve read Varsity by now, you’d probably know me as a one hundred \\npercentage equities guy. I’ve mentioned this in several places with due \\ncaution that 100% equity is not perhaps the right approach to build a long \\nterm portfolio. I always knew that I have to fix this and start to diversify my \\nlittle savings. It’s just that I pushed my asset allocation plans further and \\nfurther. \\nWell, thanks to COVID, this happened – \\n  \\n  \\nA 40% decline in the Index in less than a month. All gains wiped clean. For the \\nfirst time since I started investing in the markets, I saw that the ten year SIPs \\ngo negative as well. I do not think this had happened in the 2008 market crash \\neither. Look at this chart; I’ve got this from Value Research website –  \\nPerhaps this is a strong enough reason for me to get started with asset \\ndiversification. Maybe it is a good idea for you as well if you have not thought \\nof asset allocation yet. \\nOn the asset side, you now have access to –   \\n \\n● Direct Equities \\n● Equity Mutual funds \\n● Direct Bonds \\n● Debt Mutual funds \\n● Sovereign Gold bonds \\n● Fixed Deposits from your bank \\nI think with these assets; you can build any combination of the portfolio with \\ndiﬀerent asset allocation patterns to achieve any portfolio goal. \\nIn the coming chapters, I will discuss portfolio compositions and how you can \\nset up portfolios to match your goals, but before we do that, we will next \\ndiscuss the Index fund. \\nStay tuned. \\nKey takeaways from this chapter \\n● In a tax-free bond, the coupons are tax-free \\n● PSU debt carries an implicit sovereign guarantee, and hence \\nvery low credit risk \\n● The coupon is paid as a percentage of the face value \\n● YTM of a bond is the eﬀective yield the bondholder \\nexperiences \\n● The bond buyer pays accrued interest to the bond seller  \\n  \\n \\nCHAPTER  16 \\nIndex Funds \\n16.1 Overview \\nIn chapter  6  &  7 , we discussed the basics of a mutual fund and how a fund \\nworks. Just to recap, a mutual fund is a pooled investment vehicle that takes \\nyour money, invests and manages it on your behalf. What distinguishes one \\nfund from another is the management part. There are 100s of strategies that \\nAMCs employ but broadly speaking, you can categorize them as: \\n● Active \\n● Passive \\nIn an active mutual fund, the fund manager tries to beat a benchmark or \\ndeliver  alpha . In simple terms, alpha is the excess return above a benchmark. \\nBefore we go further, it’s important to understand what a benchmark is and \\nwhy do you need a benchmark. A benchmark serves as a point of reference \\nfor measuring performance because you cannot look at the performance of a \\nmutual fund in isolation. Every mutual fund benchmarks itself to an index like \\nthe Ni\\x00y 100, Ni\\x00y Midcap 150, Ni\\x00y Smallcap 100, etc depending on the \\ncategory it operates in. Benchmarks also give you an idea of the returns you \\nwould’ve made if you had done nothing and just bought the index. \\nNow, the job of the active manager is to deliver returns over and above the \\nbenchmark. He does this by actively picking stocks or based on various \\nstrategies and by deviating from the benchmark to various degrees. For \\n  \\n\\n \\nexample, one of the most widely used strategies among mutual funds is Value \\ninvesting. Here a manager tries to pick stocks that are cheaper than their \\nintrinsic value. On the other end of the spectrum, there’s growth investing \\nwhere a manager invests in companies, as the name implies that is growing at \\na faster rate than their peers/industry and also invest most of the earnings \\nback in the business to fuel the growth. Similarly, there are hundreds and \\nthousands of approaches and strategies used by managers, which is outside \\nthe scope of this chapter, but I hope you got the idea. The job of an active \\nmanager is to beat the benchmark. \\nA passive fund or an index fund, on the other hand, simply tracks the \\nperformance of a benchmark as closely as possible. It does not try to \\noutperform or underperform the benchmark, but just match the returns \\nbefore costs (expense ratio). Mutual funds have costs, so the return of an \\nindex fund, broadly speaking, will be the benchmark returns minus costs. \\nSo, when you invest in a Ni\\x00y 50 index fund, all you are getting is Ni\\x00y 50 \\nreturns. If Ni\\x00y 50 returns 10% this year, your return will be 10% minus the \\nexpense ratio. It’s as simple as that. \\n  \\n  \\n16.2 History \\nBefore we look at the performance of active funds, why index funds make \\nsense etc, I think it’s important to know a little history about how index funds \\ncame to be. \\nThe story of how the first index fund came to be is quite fascinating. John C. \\nBogle, also known as Jack Bogle, the founder Vanguard, launched the first \\nindex fund in 1976. The fund was called the First Index Investment and \\ntracked the S&P 500 Index. The fund was later renamed as the Vanguard 500 \\nIndex Fund. For context, the S&P 500 consists of the 500 biggest US \\ncompanies, and the index is a market capitalization-weighted. Meaning, the \\ntotal free float outstanding shares of a company are multiplied by its price \\n  \\n \\nand higher the value, higher the weight of that stock in the index, and it’s that \\nsimple. Ni\\x00y and Sensex follow the same methodology as well minus a few \\ntechnicalities. \\nThe crazy thing about the first index fund is that the launch was an abject \\nfailure. Vanguard led by Jack Bogle was hoping to raise $150 million during \\nthe underwriting process but managed to raise just $11.3 million. They didn’t \\neven have enough money to buy all the shares in the index. What they ended \\nup doing is they sampled the index, they just bought enough stocks across \\nsectors to broadly resemble an index, and it worked out well in the end. If \\nJack Bogle had given up, we probably would have had to wait longer for an \\nindex fund and history would have been much diﬀerent. \\nEven though it was launched in 1976, the Vanguard 500 Index Fund didn’t \\nreach the $1 billion mark until 1990. As of writing this chapter, however, the \\nfund has $500 billion in assets and is the largest mutual fund on the planet. \\nThis fund alone is bigger than the entire Indian mutual fund industry, which \\nhas about $350 billion in assets. As for Vanguard, it is the second-largest AMC \\nin the world with over $6 trillion in assets, next only to Blackrock, which has \\nclose to $7 trillion in assets. \\nIndia \\nIDBI Principal was the first AMC to launch an index mutual fund tracking Ni\\x00y \\nin India. The scheme later became the Principal Ni\\x00y 100 Equal-Weight fund. \\nBenchmark AMC was the first to launch Ni\\x00ybees – an index exchange-traded \\nfund (ETF) tracking the Ni\\x00y 50. Benchmark was later acquired by Goldman \\nSachs India which was acquired by Reliance mutual fund which was acquired \\nby Nippon. \\n  \\n \\nToday, the biggest mutual fund in India is an Index fund – the SBI Ni\\x00y 50 ETF \\nwith over Rs 60,000 crores in AUM. Before you start thinking when did index \\nfunds become so popular in India, they aren’t 🙂  Pretty much all of the money in this ETF is from The Employees’ Provident Fund Organisation \\n(EPFO). It started investing in equities since 5 and Ni\\x00y, and Sensex ETFs \\nwere the chosen routes. The AUM if Index mutual funds is a better proxy of \\nthe popularity of these funds and as of April 2020, they just had Rs 8,800 \\ncrores in AUM.  \\nThis is nothing compared to the Rs 119,861 crores in active large-cap mutual \\nfunds, for example. \\n16.3 Definition of an index fund \\nThe active vs passive debate is one of the longest-running, loudest, and one the most controversial debates in finance, I’ll get to that later. But even when \\nit comes to the definition of an index fund, there are widely diﬀerent \\nthoughts. Today, any fund that tracks an index is called an index fund. You \\ncan technically create an index of companies whose name starts with the \\nletter  G  and then launch a fund tracking that index. But the very first index \\nfund was tracked the S&P 500 which is a market capitalization-weighted \\nindex. But according to the hardcore finance guys and academics, a true \\nindex fund is one that tracks a broad cap-weighted index like the Ni\\x00y 50, \\nS&P 500 etc. \\n  \\n \\n16.4 Do index funds work? You may be wondering given that index funds just track a benchmark and not \\nseek to outperform, how do they even make sense, it’s a fair question. \\nOutperformance is always better than just benchmark returns, right? Let’s \\nunwrap this. There are a bunch of complicated ways this can be answered, \\nbut here’s the gist. If you think about it, markets are a zero-sum game, \\nmeaning for every person making money, somebody has to lose money. \\nHere’s an illustration to explain that:   This means that all active managers collectively cannot beat the market. The \\nreason is cost, and they are the biggest drag on the performance. \\nNow forget that you read the previous paragraph for a minute and let’s look \\nat costs. An active mutual fund seeks to outperform any index, which means \\nit needs the resources to do so. This involves hiring a bunch of analysts, \\ngetting the best Chief Investment Oﬀicer(s), the best research, the best tools – \\n  \\n \\nyour Bloomberg Terminals what have you and other things. All this doesn’t \\ncome cheap, and there are costs involved. \\nHow much? Let’s compare the expense ratios of active large-cap mutual \\nfunds and index mutual funds. Moneycontrol shows the category average \\nexpense ratios, which allows you to quickly get a sense. The category average \\nexpense ratio of active mutual large-cap mutual funds (direct plans) is 1.28%  \\nThe category average for index funds, on the other hand, is 0.31%.  \\nNote: the average expense ratios will be far higher for regular plans of mutual \\nfunds. \\nThat’s almost a 1% diﬀerence. Though this might seem small, costs \\ncompound over a long period and significantly eat into your returns. If you \\nare investing on Coin, you’d have already realized this and made the smart \\nchoice. But just to reiterate, you can use the savings calculator on Coin to \\ncalculate the impact of costs. Here’s the diﬀerence between paying .6% and \\n1.6% on a Rs 10,000 SIP over 20 years. That tiny 1% diﬀerence will cost you Rs \\n12.8 lakhs. \\n  \\n  \\nAssuming that an active mutual fund is charging 1.5% is benchmarked to \\nNi\\x00y 50 for example and let’s assume that the Ni\\x00y Index fund charges 0.10%. \\nRight out of the gate, the active fund is at a disadvantage and has to generate \\n1.4% just to keep up with the benchmark, and I am not even talking about \\noutperforming the benchmark. \\nIndex funds, on the other hand, are extremely cheap. The SBI Ni\\x00y ETF \\ncharges 0.07% for comparison. The reason why index funds and ETFs are \\ncheap is that they don’t need highly paid star fund managers, research teams \\netc. All they have to do is copy an index, and that’s it.  16.5 Historical Performance \\nLet’s look at the historical performance of active funds and index funds. I \\nknow at this point, you are thinking about those huge past returns displayed \\nprominently on AMC sites, Value research and elsewhere. S&P – the world’s \\n  \\n \\nlargest index provider publishes a semi-annual report called the S&P Indices \\nVersus Active ( SPIVA® ) scorecard. This report looks at the performance of \\nactive funds versus a standardized benchmark period for 1,3,5,10 periods. \\nHere’s how the Indian active mutual funds have fared as of the  end of 2019 .  On 5 years, 82% of active large-cap funds have underperformed the S&P BSE \\n100 index, which consists of the 100 largest Indian companies by market cap. \\nAlthough the performance of mid and small-caps looks promising, things \\nseem to be changing. With the recategorization exercise, SEBI has clearly \\ndefined the universe of stocks fund managers can invest in which will make \\noutperformance harder. Up until last year, we didn’t have mid-cap index \\nmutual funds, we had ETFs, but they were illiquid. Several AMCs have started \\nlaunching them over the past year or so. \\nAs for small-caps, active or passive, I don’t think investors should invest in \\nthese funds at all. They seem to fall as fast as they go up, which makes it \\nfrustrating for investors to hold on to. That gut-wrenching volatility also \\nincreasing the chances of investors buying high and selling low. \\n16.6 Bottomline \\nBased on the numbers at any given point, your chances of picking a \\nconsistently performing active fund is worse than 50:50. In the case of \\nlarge-caps, it’s consistently worse. And it’s going to get worse as the Indian \\ncapital markets deepen. Let’s take the case of large-caps, and there are 40 \\nAMCs and 40 large-cap funds. Broadly speaking everybody pretty much has \\naccess to the same information and everybody can only invest in the top 100 \\n  \\n \\nstocks, outperforming the benchmark isn’t easy, not to mention the cost \\ndisadvantage they have vs index funds. \\nAnd there’s also the issue of funds just hugging benchmarks which is quite common – this is also referred to as closet indexing. Most funds don’t deviate \\nsignificantly from the benchmarks, and a\\x00er expenses, they are guaranteed \\nto underperform the index. \\nThere’s another way of looking at this. Famed researcher Michael \\nMauboussin,  in this paper , termed this the paradox of skill: \\n“In cases where two or more players have the same level of skill—whether that \\nskill is high or low doesn’t matter—the skills of the players oﬀset one another \\nand luck becomes the primary determinant of the outcome. “Players” can be \\nathletes, investors, or business executives. In many competitive realms, \\nincluding investing, the skills of the participants have improved on an absolute \\nbasis but have shrunk on a relative basis. Today’s investor has vastly more \\nresources and training than his or her predecessor from years past. The \\nproblem is that investors, broadly speaking, have gotten much better which \\nmeans that the diﬀerence between the skill of the best and the average \\nparticipant isn’t as great as it used to be” \\n16.7 Fixed income (Debt) \\nSo far, when I say an index fund, I’ve meant equity index funds. Globally in the \\nlast 5-10 years index funds including debt index funds, have experienced phenomenal growth. Bond ETFs recently crossed the $1 trillion mark in the \\nUS. In case you are wondering if there are any debt index funds in India, these \\nare very early days for equity index funds, let alone debt index funds. Except \\n  \\n \\nfor the recently launched Bharat Bond ETF and fund of fund, we don’t have \\nany debt index funds. \\nThe Indian debt markets are very tiny and notoriously illiquid. Except for \\nG-Secs and the best AAA-rated bonds, most other bonds trade sparingly. And \\nunlike equities which trade on the exchanges and there’s transparent price \\ndiscovery, most of the trading activity in bonds happens over the counter \\n(OTC) or oﬀ-market. It’s the same even in the US, where the debt market is \\nbigger than the equity market. \\nThis, among many other things, makes indexing debt very hard, but maybe as \\nthe markets evolve, things should change. There are companies like \\nTradeweb  trying to bring electronic trading to the bond markets. \\n16.8 Active or passive (Conclusion) \\nA\\x00er reading all this, you might be wondering if you should choose active or \\nindex funds. It’s not active or passive but active and passive. You can mix both \\nin your portfolio and have allocation based on your risk tolerance. But always \\npick a fund that has a long track record and sticks it’s stated mandate. Before \\nthe SEBI scheme recategorization exercise, funds didn’t have any restrictions \\non how they could invest. Some funds used to be labelled large-cap and used \\nto invest in mid-cap and small-caps to juice returns. So, picking a fund where \\nthe manager does what he says is important. Funds with cowboy managers \\npretty much always end up as disasters.   \\n  \\n  \\nI have also mentioned exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the chapter, although \\nthey are similar to index funds, there are some important diﬀerences. In the \\nnext chapter, we’ll discuss ETFs. Similar to index funds, there’s a category of \\nfunds called smart-beta funds, which have grown increasingly popular over \\nthe past decade. The term “smart beta” is meaningless, at the core these are \\nrules-based funds, and we’ll also briefly understand the basics.               \\n  \\n  \\nCHAPTER  17 \\nArbitrage Funds  \\n17.1 – Arbitrage \\nWe were to move ahead and discuss MF attributes and gradually steer our \\nway to identify techniques of building a mutual fund portfolio. While I was all \\nset to do that, I just remembered we hadn’t discussed the ‘Arbitrage Funds’, \\nwhich for some reason has all the market attention these days. So I’ll keep \\nthis chapter short, consider the Arbitrage fund and move ahead. \\nBefore we understand the ‘Arbitrage Fund’, we need to understand what \\n‘Arbitrage’ means. Of course, if you are a regular Varsity reader, then this is \\nsomething you guys are familiar. We have discussed arbitrage on a couple of \\noccasions, in particular, we have looked at arbitrage in the form of calendar \\nspreads, pair trading, and put-call parity. \\nFor others who are not familiar with ‘Arbitrage’, here is a quick note. \\nAll of us, at some point in life, would have carried out an arbitrage \\ntransaction. For example, when I was in my 1st-year college, I’d pay my cousin \\nin Singapore to buy me Rock n Roll audio cassettes from Rs.100/- per tape \\nand sell the same here in Bangalore for Rs.150/-. People here would happily \\nbuy the tape at Rs.150/- because there was no other source for them to buy \\nthese tapes. \\n  \\n\\n \\nThe above is an arbitrage transaction.  \\nIn an arbitrage transaction, you buy an asset (like the audiotape) from one \\nmarket (Singapore) where the asset is selling cheap (Rs.100/-) and sell the \\nsame asset (the audiotape) in another market (Bangalore) for a higher price \\n(150). The arbitrageur (i.e. me in this example), makes a risk free profit \\n(Rs.50/- in this case). If you think about this, arbitrage is beautiful, right? If the above were to hold, \\nall I had to do in life was buy tapes from Singapore and sell the same in \\nBangalore. I do this in large quantities, and I’d be sitting on a massive pile of \\ncash. \\nBut if only life was that easy 🙂 The assumption here is that there are continuous supply and demand in both \\nmarkets. I mean imagine a situation where I buy tapes worth Rs.100,000/- \\nwith a hope to sell it for Rs.150,000/- and suddenly I realise that people in \\n  \\n \\nBangalore are no longer interested in Rock n Roll, but instead prefer listening \\nto Boyzone! Then my money is gone, right? \\nSo the point is, unlike the popular notion, arbitrage is not risk-free. What we \\ndiscussed is an example of the supply-demand risk associated with the \\narbitrage opportunity. \\nBut it is not just that. \\nImagine another scenario, where a friend of mine figures my little trick, and \\nhe does the same, i.e. buy tapes from Singapore at Rs.100/- but sells the same \\nat a slightly lower rate at say Rs.140/- to ensure he beats me at my own game. \\nWhat do you think would happen next? A price war would break, I’d oﬀer the \\nsame at say 135, he would then reduce to 125 so on as so forth till all the \\nmargins evaporate. \\nPoint being, arbitrage opportunity or arbitrage profits shrink when more \\npeople try to exploit the same opportunity. \\nNow, think about the stock markets. Take a look at the snapshot below –  \\nWhat you see here is the quote for Kirloskar Industries, on NSE it is trading at \\n562.4 per share, and on BSE the same company is trading at 546.40 per share. \\nThere is a diﬀerence of 16 Rupees. \\n  \\n \\nThe above is an arbitrage opportunity. All you have to do is buy Kirloskar \\nIndustries at 546.4 in BSE and sell the same stock in NSE at 562.4. A\\x00er all, it’s \\nthe same asset but two diﬀerent prices in two diﬀerent markets. If one were to execute this transaction well, then a 16 Rupee profit is more or \\nless guaranteed. \\nA mutual fund scheme that manages money by mostly chasing such arbitrage \\nopportunities in the market is called ‘The Arbitrage Fund’.  17.2 – The  Arbitrage Fund \\nWhile we looked at one type of arbitrage opportunity in the previous section, \\nin reality, there are many types of arbitrage opportunities in the market. \\nFor instance, one of the most attractive arbitrage opportunity that the mutual \\nfund looks for is the ‘Spot-Future’ arbitrage, wherein the futures trade at a \\nprice which is significantly away from its fair value when compared to its \\nunderlying price. \\nIn other words, at any given point, the fund is continuously long or short on \\nthe stock in either the equity or futures market. \\nDid the above line confuse you? Let me elaborate this a bit just to give you \\nclarity on what happens under the hood of an Arbitrage Fund. Take a look at \\nthe snapshot below –  \\n  \\n \\nAs of today, i.e. 18th June 2020, the stock price of Maruti is at Rs.5,714.4/- per \\nshare. However, Maruti’s future’s is trading at Rs.5,735.6/-. \\nThe diﬀerence between cash and futures is – 5,735.6 – 5,714.4 \\n=  21.2 \\nThe diﬀerence between cash and futures is called the spread or the basis. One \\ncan capture the spread by setting up an arbitrage. Remember the thumb rule \\nin arbitrage is to buy the asset in the cheaper market and sell the same asset \\nin the expensive market. Hence, all one has to do here is – \\nBuy Maruti @ 5714.4 in the cash market \\nSell Maruti Futures (Exping in June)@ 5735.6 \\nIt is important to ensure the above transaction is simultaneously executed. \\nOnce you do, you’ve locked in the spread, and it no longer matters where \\nMaruti trades because the spread of 21.6 is guaranteed. \\nThe key here is the fact that on the expiry day, Maruti in cash and Futures will \\ntrade at a single price (unlike today). The phenomenon is called \\n‘Cash-Futures Convergence’. So this trade has to be unwound or squared oﬀ \\nor closed on the expiry day. \\nFor example, assume on the expiry day, Maruti trades at 5780 in both the cash \\nand futures market. The P&L is as follows – \\nCash market trade \\nBuy @ 5714.4 \\n  \\n \\nSell @ 5780. \\nP&L =5780 – 5714.4 \\n= + 65.6 \\nHere you make a profit of 65.6. \\nFutures market trade – \\nSell @ 5735.6 \\nBuy @ 5780 \\nP&L =5735.6- 5780 \\n= -44.4 \\nHere you make a loss of 44.4. \\nSo, on the one hand, you make a profit of 65.6, and on the other, you lose \\n44.4, but overall you make 21.2, i.e. 65.6 – 44.4. \\nThe point here is that the spread is locked and you make that no matter what \\nhappens. I’d encourage you to do the same math at few other price points \\nand see what happens. \\nOf course, there are other technicalities like rollover, transaction costs, \\nexecution risk, etc. But there is no point getting into these details. All you \\nneed to do if understand what arbitrage is and what happens in an arbitrage \\nfund. \\nHave a look at the following; this is an extract of the investment objective of \\nDSP’s Arbitrage fund – \\n  \\n  \\nAs you can see, the fund simply states that they aim to generate income \\nthrough the cash and derivatives market, without getting into specific \\nstrategy details. Some of the funds also use the term ‘low volatility returns’ in \\ntheir scheme description.  \\nA pure arbitrage trade such as the spot-futures arbitrage is inherently less \\nrisky with a predictable outcome; hence it is naturally low volatile. \\nHowever, one should not take this at face value. Yes, if the fund is 100% \\nfocused on arbitrage opportunities, the low volatility bit would have been \\nvalid. But then, look at SEBI’s definition of the Arbitrage Fund –  \\nAn Arbitrage fund has a minimum of 65% of the funds in Arbitrage strategies, \\nwhich implies that they are free to do whatever they want with the balance of \\n  \\n \\n35% of the funds. There is no restriction on that. The usual practice for \\nArbitrage funds is to invest the balance 35% in debt funds, and since there is a \\nrestriction on duration, funds usually chase yields. Given this, an arbitrage \\nfund is not a ‘low volatile’ 🙂 Have a look at the portfolio of ICICI Pru’s Arbitrage fund –  \\nEvery single equity position is hedged with its futures; these are mostly \\narbitrage positions. As we can see, nearly 65% of the exposure is the arbitrage \\nposition. The balance 35% is parked in debt and cash – \\n  \\n  \\nThe presence of debt papers is what makes the arbitrage funds risky. How \\nrisky may you ask? Well, look at this –  \\nIf I’m not wrong, Principal Arbitrage Fund held a concentrated debt position \\nin DHLF bonds, which DHFL defaulted upon sometime in October 2018. \\nNaturally, the fund took a hit, and the NAV nose-dived from 11.5 to about \\n10.9, translating to a run of 5.22%. \\n  \\n \\nIn all fairness, 5.22% is not a big hit, but the problem is the time spent on \\nrecovery. It took nearly 1.5 years to recover 5.22% and push the NAV back to 11.5. \\nThis chart teaches us three lessons about the Arbitrage fund – \\n● As many investors believe, Arbitrage funds are not risk-free. Thanks to \\nthe debt component, there is an element of risk. \\n● Returns hover in the range of about 5-7%, which can get wiped out in a \\nsingle shot if things go wrong. ● Recovery takes time. Hence it is prudent to have a long term \\ninvestment horizon while investing in an arbitrage fund. \\nI hope I’ve not scared you away from investing in an Arbitrage fund 🙂 The good part of an arbitrage fund is that it behaves as a debt fund but gets \\ntaxed as an equity fund. We will have a chapter dedicated to mutual fund \\ntaxation, till then, here is how taxation works (very broadly) – \\n● Gains from Equity funds sold within 12 months are treated as short \\nterm capital gain, attracts a 15% tax. \\n● Gains from Equity funds sold a\\x00er 12 months are treated as long term \\ncapital gain, attracts a 10% tax, a\\x00er an exemption of Rs.1,00,000/- \\n● Gain from debt funds held for less than 36 months is treated as short \\nterm capital gains, attracts a tax as per the investor’s income tax slab. \\n● Gain from debt funds held for more than 36 months is treated as long \\nterm capital gains, attracts a 20% tax post indexation. \\n  \\n \\nGiven the tax treatment, in my opinion, if you are prepared to take some risk, \\nthen use the Arbitrage fund as a proxy for say low duration or a short duration \\nfund. The risk and return profile are similar for these funds. \\nHence, in my opinion, the real arbitrage in an arbitrage fund is the tax \\narbitrage, i.e. it behaves like a debt fund and gets taxed as an equity fund. \\nLastly, when you look for an arbitrage fund, it is essential to look at the debt \\ncomponent of the portfolio. Ensure the fund does not have concentrated debt \\npositions and also ensure the there are no papers which are below investible \\ngrade. \\nAlso, it is crucial to confirm that the arbitrage fund is not holding any \\nunhedged equity position because this defeats the purpose of an arbitrage \\nfund. \\nNext up is Mutual fund metrics. Stay tuned. \\nKey takeaways from this chapter \\n1. Arbitrage funds are hedged position \\n2. SEBI mandates AMCs to invest a minimum of 65% in arbitrage \\nstrategies \\n3. Mutual funds usually spend up to 35% in debt \\n4. Arbitrage funds can be volatile \\n5. One can consider Arbitrage funds as a proxy for low/short \\nduration funds \\n  \\n  \\nCHAPTER  18 \\nMeasuring Mutual Fund Returns   18.1 – Mutual Fund metrics \\nBy now, I suppose we understand diﬀerent types of mutual fund categories \\nand what goes under the hood of each of these funds. While we have not \\ncovered the entire gamut of funds, I think we have covered the most \\nimportant funds across both equity and debt. \\nProbably I must have discussed the Balanced fund as well, not sure why (and \\nhow) I missed that. But I also believe we have laid down a foundation for \\nstructured thinking about funds and their mandates. So I’d request you to \\nplease look upon few balanced fund factsheets, read it along with the SEBI’s \\nclassification and you will understand how the balanced fund works. \\nOtherwise, you can always drop your queries here, and I’ll be more than happy to answer them for you. \\nAnyway, I think we are now one step closer to understand how one can build \\na mutual fund portfolio for diﬀerent financial goals. Before we get into the \\nbuilding MF portfolios, we must spend time to understand few mutual fund \\nmetrics that help us understand mutual funds better and the ways to \\ndiﬀerentiate good funds from the not so good funds. \\n  \\n\\n \\nThe metrics that I’m talking about are all mentioned in the Mutual fund \\nfactsheet, and few others are mentioned in the 3rd party website such as Morningstar and Value research. We need to pick and choose the right set of \\nmetrics to learn and ignore the pointless ones. \\nOver the next few chapters, we will understand the following metrics that are \\nusually published by the AMCs for the diﬀerent schemes that they run – \\n1. Returns – Absolute, CAGR, XIRR \\n2. Rolling Returns \\n3. Expense Ratio \\n4. Benchmarking \\n5. Exit load 6. Portfolio turnover ratio \\n7. Standard Deviation \\n8. Beta \\n9. Sharpe Ratio \\n10.Capture ratios \\nOf course, along the way, if I feel I’ve missed an important metrics, then I’ll \\njust add that to the list and discuss the same. \\nSo as you can see, we have a lot to cover, so let’s get started. \\n18.2 – Measuring MF investment performance \\nMutual fund investors o\\x00en get confused with the way returns are measured \\nacross investments. Most investors apply the standard return measurement \\ntechnique across all types of investment. Doing so leads to wrong return \\n  \\n \\ncalculation and therefore, wrong analysis. Return measurement is one of the \\nkey aspects while analyzing a mutual fund. We should start our discussion \\nwith the basic concept of return measurement.  \\nFor the sake of this discussion, I’ll assume that you are familiar with the \\nsystematic investment plan or the SIP. I guess the AMCs and the regulators \\nhave managed to do a phenomenal job at conveying the concept of SIP to \\nevery taxpayer in the country (well, all most all). \\nHence, I will not spend time to discuss what a SIP is and its massive \\nadvantage for an investor. If you are not familiar with what a SIP is, I will \\nrequest you to spend a little time on the internet; there are tons of great \\narticles with SIP calculators to help you understand what a SIP is and how to \\nset up one. \\n  \\n \\nHowever, for the sake of the completeness of this discussion, let me highlight \\ntwo popular investments techniques – \\nLumpsum investments – In a lumpsum investment, an investor decides to \\ninvest a random amount (based on cash available) at one time. Example – I \\nget a yearly bonus of Rs.1,00,000/-, of which I decide to invest Rs.75,000/- in a \\nmutual fund. \\nSystematic Investment Plan (SIP) – SIP investments requires you to invest a \\nfixed amount of money on a fixed monthly date in a designated fund. The \\ninvestment can be weekly, fortnightly, monthly, quarterly, or even once in 6 \\nmonths. For example, my very first SIP was set to invest Rs.2,500/- on 5th of \\nevery month in Sundaram Midcap fund. There is no end date to this and can \\ngo on for as long as possible. \\nThe way one measures the return for these two investments is very diﬀerent. \\nMost investors take the starting and ending value of their investment and \\nfigure out what the return is. While this is one way to measure returns, this is \\nnot the only way. While measuring return, you need to factor time into \\nconsideration. \\nFor example, if I tell you that I made an 80% return on a certain investment, \\nwhat would your first reaction be? I guess you’d say its amazing. \\nNow, what if said that I made 80% over 15 years? Does it look attractive? I \\ndon’t think so, right? Time adds a very important dimension while we \\nmeasure the return. Hence it is always important to consider time. \\nGiven the two types of investment, let us separate these investments into \\ndiﬀerent time buckets – \\n  \\n  \\nThe table above helps us understand the diﬀerent types of investment and \\nthe respective type of return we should calculate. For example, we should \\ncalculate the absolute return for a lumpsum investment which is less than \\none year. Likewise, we should look at the XIRR return for a SIP which is older \\nthan a year. \\nAlthough for you as a mutual fund investor, you don’t really have to learn how \\nto calculate the absolute return, CAGR or XIRR because there are tons of free \\nreturn calculators available online. However, I think it will just make you a \\nprudent investor if you take a little time to figure out how this can be done. \\nLet’s start with the absolute return. \\nRemember Absolute Return matters only if the investment is less than a year. \\nIt could be a lump sum or a SIP, but as long as the investment is less than a \\nyear, use absolute return. \\nThe calculation is straight forward. Here is an example – \\nOn Jan 1st 2020, I invest Rs.25,000 in a Mutual Fund. On July 7th, the value of \\nthis fund is Rs.30,000/-. What is the return generated? \\nYou should recognise that this is a lump sum invested and is under a year. \\nThe absolute return can be calculated as – \\n  \\n \\n[Ending Value/Beginning Value] – 1 \\n= 30,000/25,000 – 1 \\n= 20% \\nLet’s take another case. An investor invests Rs.5,000/- every month in a \\nMutual Fund. A\\x00er six months, the value of the investment is Rs.35,000/-. \\nWhat is the return experience here? \\nWe know that this is a case of SIP investments. \\nMonthly investment – Rs.5,000/- \\nNumber of months – 6 (less than one year) \\nTotal investment value = 5000 * 6 = Rs.30,000/- \\nCurrent value of investment = Rs.35,000/- \\nWe need to apply the absolute value calculation here – \\n=35,000/30,000 -1 \\n=17% \\nFor SIPs less than one year, we can indeed calculate XIRR, but from my \\nexperience, the most investor will not comprehend this number well as it is \\nnon-intuitive. \\nLet us revisit the SIP for less than one year a little later to understand why this \\nmay not be the best choice. For now, all you need to know if that if an \\ninvestment (lumpsum or SIP) is less than a year, then you have to use \\nabsolute returns. \\n  \\n \\nNext up is the CAGR. \\nCAGR or the Compounded Annual Growth Rate measures the ‘rate at which \\nthe investment is growing’. Let us take a quick example and deep dive into \\nthis – I invest Rs.25,000/- on 1st of July 2017 in a certain Mutual Fund. Three years \\nlater, the investment has grown to Rs.40,000/-.  What is the return on this \\ninvestment? \\nI’ve kept the question in bold to draw your attention to the question itself. We \\nwill revisit that in a bit. \\nYou should identify that this is a lumpsum investment. Since the period is \\nmore than one year, we need to use the CAGR to calculate the return. The formula to calculate the CAGR is straight forward – \\n[Ending Value / Starting Value ]^(1/n) – 1 \\nWhere n is time in years. Let us apply this formula – \\n= [40,000/25,000]^(1/3)-1 \\n= 16.96% \\nThe investment made in this fund has grown at a rate of 16.96% on year on \\nyear basis. Recognise that this is  the growth rate of the investment. \\nThe most common confusion for the investor is this – \\nI invest 25,000, which has grown to 40,000, which means a profit of 15,000. \\nThe return should is about 60%, i.e. 15K profit on 25K investment. \\n  \\n \\nOf course, there is nothing wrong with this calculation. A\\x00er all, this is the \\nabsolute return we are calculating here. \\nThe question, however, is that did you get this 60% in the first, 2nd, or 3rd \\nyear? Was it that you got the entire return in the 1st year and since then the \\ninvestment has stayed flat? Or was the return generated in the 3rd year with \\nthe first two years netting zero return? \\nOf course, one can get into the depths of this and figure the details. But \\notherwise, we simply ignore the specifics and take the average growth on \\nyear on year basis. Higher the average the better investment this is. \\nTo put this in perspective, think about a road journey. Let us say you are \\ntravelling from Delhi to Jaipur by car. \\nIf I ask you at what speed you drove your car, will you tell me that your drove \\nat 80 kmph from Delhi to Gurugram, 110 kmph from Gurugram to Panchgaon, \\nabout 90 kmph between Panchgaon to Neemrana so on and so forth or will \\nyou just tell me that you drove an average speed of 100 kmph? \\nYou won’t give me the split; you will give me average speed. \\nLikewise, when we look at a multi-year investment period, the years in \\nbetween are like the town on a journey. Based on the market conditions (just \\nlike the traﬀic) investment generates diﬀerent returns (like driving at a \\ndiﬀerent speed) during these years. Some years may be positive, and few may \\nbe negative. \\n  \\n \\nAs a long term investor, we ignore these yearly variations in returns and take \\nan average return of the investment, which is what CAGR does. It is the \\ngrowth rate of investment. \\nNow, go back to the initial question, which was intentionally kept in bold. Do \\nyou think that is the right question? \\nNo, the real question to ask should have been – ‘ I invest Rs.25,000/- on 1st of \\nJuly 2017 in a certain Mutual Fund. Three years later, the investment has \\ngrown to Rs.40,000/-. What is the growth rate of this investment? \\nI hope you get the subtle but a the very important distinction on the two \\ndiﬀerent questions. \\nOk, let’s go back to the Delhi and Jaipur example. I know that the average \\nspeed is 100 kmph. At this rate, how much time will you take to reach Ajmer, \\nwhich is another 150 km away from Jaipur? \\nQuite easy – I know the average speed, so you are likely to take about 1 hour \\n30 mins to reach Ajmer. \\nOn a similar note, I know the investment grew at 16.96%. What is the likely \\nvalue of my investment if I let this investment run for another say one year? \\nQuite easy – \\nCurrent value at the end 3rd year = Rs.40,000 \\nGrowth Rate – 16.96% \\nTenure – 1 yearExpected value = 40,000*(1+16.96%) — > I’m basically \\nincrementing 40,000 by 16.96% \\n  \\n \\n= Rs.46,784.28/- \\nLet us twist this a bit, what is the likely investment value if I let this \\ninvestment run for three more years? \\nThe formula is \\nCurrent value *( 1+ growth rate)^(time in year) \\n= 40000*(1+16.96%)^(3) \\n= Rs.64,000/- \\nThis is also called the future value of the investment given a certain growth \\nrate. \\nI hope you now appreciate why we need to consider the CAGR and not \\nabsolute return if the investment is more than one year. \\nOne last thing you need to note – Higher the average speed, faster you will \\nreach your destination. High speed also comes with high risk. Likewise, \\nhigher the CAGR, higher is the rate at which your investment is growing. The \\nrisk too is high in such investments as there could be fears of a crash in the \\nunderlying asset prices. \\nAnyway, I hope you are now clear about the distinction between absolute \\nreturn and CAGR and when to use which one. \\nWe will now shi\\x00 focus on XIRR, which is applicable when we do SIP over \\nmultiple years. \\n  \\n \\nXIRR stands for Extended Internal Rate of Return. XIRR comes in handy when \\nyou make regular investments in a mutual fund over an extended period. \\nHence for SIPs, you need to use XIRR to measure the growth rate. \\nAssume you invest Rs.5,000/- on 10th of every month in a mutual fund. You \\nstarted the investment process in December 2018; you continued to do so till \\nJune 2020. The SIP table looks like this –  \\nSo across 19 months, Rs.95,000/- has been invested. The investment amount \\nis within the bracket to indicate that it is a cash outflow from your bank \\naccount. \\n  \\n \\nNow, as on today, i.e. 10th July 2020, the value of this investment is \\nRs.1,10,000/-. Question is what the growth rate is? Of course, you can \\ncalculate the absolute return here. Still, hopefully, by now, you should \\nrecognize that this is a multi-year investment and absolute return does not \\nserve any purpose. \\nThe traditional CAGR also does not help because there are multiples \\ninvestments across multiple periods. However, we still use CAGR, but with \\nslight modifications. One can say that XIRR is a modified version of CAGR \\nwhich accommodates for staggered investments. \\nThe XIRR formula is quite intimidating. I’d suggest you do a Google image \\nsearch with ‘XIRR Formula’ as the keyword and you’ll know what I’m referring \\ntoo. But luckily we need not have to apply that formula. \\nMS Excel has an XIRR function that you can use. The function itself is quite straightforward to use – \\n  \\n  \\nIf you notice, I’ve included the current value of the investment, I have \\nhighlighted this in bold (above the arrow mark). The number is not in \\nbrackets to indicate the fact that I can get this as positive cash flow into my \\nbank account if I decide to exit the investment today. \\nThe excel function to calculate XIRR requires two inputs – \\n1. The series of cash outflows and the current value of the investment     2. The respective dates of cash flow and the date of the current value \\n  \\n \\nOnce you feed these inputs, excel does what it is supposed to do and throws \\nout the XIRR or the growth rate number for you –  \\nAs you can see, the growth rate or the XIRR is 18.79%. \\nNow, if you scroll up, you will see that I mentioned that you could use XIRR for \\nreturns for less than one year, but it’s non-intuitive, therefore its better to \\nsticks to absolute return. \\nLet me demonstrate why so. Have a look at this – \\n  \\n  \\nThis is a SIP of Rs.5,000/- for five months. The total investment is Rs.25,000/-. \\nAssume the current value on 10th May 2019 is Rs.30,000/-. If I compute the \\nXIRR for this –  \\nXIRR tells me that the investment has returned 106%. Do you think this is \\nintuitive? I don’t think so, because a regular MF investor sees a gain of 5,000 \\nover a 25,000 investment. It will be very hard to convince him that the growth \\nrate of his investment is 106%. \\nHence, for this reason, most platforms show the absolute return for SIPs less \\nthan a year, rather than XIRR. In this case, the absolute return is 20%, which is \\nintuitive for the vast majority. \\n18.3 – XIRR and CAGR are the same \\n  \\n \\nI would like to discuss one last thing about XIRR and CAGR. I mentioned that \\nXIRR is a modified version of CAGR. Both XIRR and CAGR serve the same \\npurpose, i.e. to measure the rate of return over a multi-year period. \\nIt’s just that XIRR comes in handy when we have a SIP kind of investment \\nsituation. Now, if you think about it, then XIRR and CAGR should yield the \\nsame result for a lumpsum investment made over one year. \\nLet’s take an example – \\nInvestment date – 3rd Jan 2018 \\nInvestment amount – Rs.1,00,000/- \\nToday’s date – 3rd Jan 2020 \\nCurrent value of investment – Rs.1,25,000/- \\nThe CAGR works out to – \\n[1,25,000/1,00,000]^(1/2)-1 \\n= 11.8% \\nIf you run the XIRR function on the same set of numbers –  \\nYou get the same answer. I hope you get the logic behind XIRR and CAGR. \\n  \\n \\nI’d want you to do an exercise as a follow-up activity. Please visit an AMC \\nwebsite, or visit coin.zerodha.com, pick a fund and observe how the returns \\nare mentioned. You should now be in a position to understand what is being \\nreported and what the returns mean. \\nDo share your experience by commenting below. \\nUp next is the rolling returns of a Mutual Fund. Stay tuned. \\nKey takeaways from this chapter \\n1. For lumpsum investments less than one year, use absolute \\nreturn \\n2. For SIP investments less than one year, use absolute return \\n3. For lumpsum investments over a year use CAGR \\n4. For SIP investments over a year, use XIRR \\n5. CAGR is the growth rate of an investment \\n6. XIRR is a modified form of CAGR \\n7. CAGR and XIRR are same for lumpsum investments over 1 year      \\n  \\n \\nCHAPTER  19 \\nRolling Returns   19.1 – Point to Point return  The previous chapter gave us a perspective of how returns are calculated \\ngiven the time frame under consideration. So, now if I were to provide you \\nwith the following data point –  Fund – Aditya Birla Frontline Equity \\nStarting date – 2nd January 2013 \\nStarting investment value – Rs.1,00,000/- \\nStarting NAV – 100.83 \\nEnding date – 2nd January 2015 \\nEnding NAV – 161.83  And asked to find out the returns, you’d probably do it with ease. Let us do \\nthe math –  Number of units = 1,00,000/ 100.83 = 991.7683 The ending value of investment  = 991.7683 * 161.83 \\n= Rs.1,60,497.9 \\n  \\n\\n \\nThe growth in this lumpsum investment over two years can be calculated by \\napplying the  CAGR formula –  = [160497.9/100000]^(1/2) – 1 \\n=26.69%.  Which as would recognize is a phenomenal growth rate.  Now, let us say you are mighty impressed with your investment, and you start \\nto propagate the fund. A friend walks up to you asks for the performance, and \\nyou proudly declare the 2-year growth rate is 26.96%.  Your friend is impressed and decides to invest.  Now, I want you to think about this for a moment. What do you think is the \\nfundamental flaw here?  Did you lie about your investment to your friend? – No \\nDid you lie or mislead your friend by letting him know the returns you’ve \\nenjoyed? – No \\nWell, then what do you think is wrong here? \\nThe growth rate of 26.96% is a massive generalization of two-year growth \\nrate. When you mentioned this return to your friend would believe that this is \\nthe kind of performance even he is likely to enjoy.  The 26.96% return is valid when the money is invested on 2nd January 2013 \\nand measure its growth on 2nd January 2015. In other words, the growth rate \\nis really only for this starting and ending points; it is right for these exact two \\ndates.  It is a very personalized experience.    \\n \\nIf I were to invest and measure the returns on any other dates, then the \\nprofits will be diﬀerent.  So, whenever you measure returns or growth between two dates, the value \\nyou calculate is only valid for the two years under consideration. Hence, such \\na measurement of returns is also called the ‘Point to point’ return.  To get an accurate representation of how the two-year return (growth rate) \\nlooks, you need to calculate the ‘Rolling Returns’.  19.2 – Rolling Return  The rolling return gives us a perspective of how the ‘n years’ return (growth) \\nhas evolved over the last ‘n years’.  Sounds confusing? I’m sure it is, so here is \\nwhat we will do.   We will take up an example and figure out the rolling return calculation. I’m \\nsure understanding the rolling return concept becomes much easier if you \\nknow the math behind.    \\n \\nBy the way, many websites publish the mutual fund’s rolling return, so it is \\nnot essential to remember how to calculate the rolling returns. However, by \\nknowing the rolling returns math, you will understand the concept of rolling \\nreturn quite easily.  So let us get started.  I’ve got the historical NAV data of AB Frontline Equity Growth-Direct. The \\nstarting date is from 2nd January 2013, and I’ve got this till 2nd January 2020, \\nthat’s about seven years of data.     \\n \\nMy objective here is to find out the 2-year rolling return for this fund. To do \\nthis, I’ll have to start in 2015.  I take the NAV on 2nd January 2015 and the NAV 2 years ago, i.e. on 2nd \\nJanuary 2013 and calculate the return between these two data points. Next, I \\nmove the date by one day, i.e. between 3rd January 2015 and 3rd January \\n2013, take the NAV for these two dates and calculate the return between \\nthese dates. I’ll again move the date by one day, i.e. 4th January 2015/2013 \\nand calculate the return.  So on and so forth, such that I have a time series of 2-year return.  Let us calculate the first rolling return –  NAV on 2nd January 2013 – 100.83 \\nNAV on 2nd January 2015 – 161.83 \\nSince its two years, we apply CAGR –  [161.83/100.83]^(1/2)-1 \\n26.69% \\nThe 2nd rolling return in this series would be –  NAV on 3rd January 2013 – 101.29 \\nNAV on 3rd January 2015 – 161.45 \\n=[161.45/101.29]^(1/2)-1 \\n26.25% \\n  \\n \\nI suppose you get the sequence. I’ve stacked up the data side by side on excel, \\nand this is how it looks –   The starting date is 2nd January 2015, right up to 2nd January 2020.  As you can see, I have the latest date and NAV (shaded in blue). Next to this, I \\nhave the date and NAV for two years ago (shaded in pale yellow). I have \\ncalculated the CAGR against these two NAVs. If I do the CAGR across all the \\ndates, I get a time series of the daily 2-year return starting from 2nd January \\n2015.  Before we proceed, let us look at this statement about rolling return again – \\n‘Rolling return gives us a perspective of how the ‘n years’ return (growth) has \\nevolved over the last ‘n years’. Does this sound confusing now? \\n  \\n \\nI hope not ☺  \\nAnyway, one minor thing to note here – look at the 2nd data point, I have NAV \\nfor 5th January 2015, but I don’t have the NAV for 5th January 2013, but \\ninstead have the NAV data for 3rd January 2013, which I’ve used. As you may \\nhave guessed, this happens due to the weekend factor. So I’d suggest you \\nignore this bit.  Also, at this point, you should realize that if my objective were to calculate the 1-year rolling return, my starting point would be 2014, and if the objective is \\nto estimate three years rolling return, then I would start from 2016.  Now that we have the Rolling Return time series starting from 2015, I can do a \\ncouple of things with the data. To begin with, we can calculate the range of \\nreturns for the time series we have calculated. To estimate the range, we \\nsimply have to calculate the max and min.  Here is the max –         \\n \\nAnd here is the min –   What does this mean? Well, assume two people invested in the AB Frontline \\nEquity fund. The lucky person invested on 19th August 2013 and pulled out \\nhis investment on 19th August 2015. This person makes 37.76%.  The unlucky fellow also invested for two years, but he/she invested on 19th \\nSeptember 2017 and stayed invested till 19th September 2019. Unfortunately, \\nthis person lost money!  The point that I’m trying to make is that no two, 2-year returns are the same. \\nThe returns change depending on when you choose to invest and when you \\ndecide to pull out your investment.  Here is a graph of the rolling 2-year return starting from 2015.    \\n  \\nAnd as you can see, the two-year returns have ranged from 37% to nearly \\n-1.0%. If you were to invest for two years, then your return could have been \\nanywhere within this range.  To get a perspective of the likely 2-year return, you can take an average of the \\nrolling returns; this is called the ‘Rolling Return Average’.  The average is 15.35%.  So as you can see, the rolling return gives us a lot more insights compared to \\na point to point return.  So the next time you want to invest in a mutual fund, as a part of the analysis, \\ninclude these two things –  1. Identify the period you are interested in investing \\n2. Find out the historical rolling return min, max, and average for the \\nperiod \\n  \\n \\nFor example, if I’m looking at investing in a large-cap equity fund for seven \\nyears, I’ll check the historical 7-year rolling return for that particular fund. By \\ndoing so, I will get a perspective of historical return range plus its average.  In my opinion, this is much better than looking at a point to point return. By \\nthe way, I’ve used 2 years rolling return as an example. If you are looking at \\ninvesting in EQ funds, then please consider at least 5 years rolling returns or \\nhigher.  In the next chapter, let us discuss other MF metrics that matter.  Key takeaways from this chapter \\n1. Point to point return gives a perspective of the return only for \\nthe two days under consideration  2. Point to point return should not be taken as a generalization of \\nreturn  3. The rolling return gives a better perspective of the return \\n4. Rolling return average is a better representation of the returns \\none can expect     \\n  \\n \\nCHAPTER  20 \\nMutual fund Expense Ratio, Direct, and Regular \\nplans  \\n20.1 – Expense Ratio \\nIn the last chapter, we discussed the ‘Rolling Returns’, and why rolling returns \\noﬀer a better insight into the return pattern compared to a simple point to \\npoint return. Continuing from the previous chapter, we will discuss a few \\nmore important metrics related to mutual funds. \\nIn this chapter, we focus on the expense ratio of a mutual fund. Of course, this \\nis the 20th chapter in this module, and I suppose we have mentioned \\n‘expense ratio’, in passing multiples times. However, we never formally \\nintroduced the concept of the expense ratio of a mutual fund. So let us do \\nthat before we proceed. \\nThink about services like Tata Sky, Netflix, Swiggy, or even Dunzo, these are \\nall services that you consume fairly regularly (I assume) and therefore you \\npay for it. Why would you pay for it? Well, because there is a real cost involved. For example, a Dunzo executive has to ride his bike to the store, pick \\nup the item, deliver the same to your house. So there is fuel, labour, tech, and \\nother expenses involved. Hence we pay a fee to cover for these costs plus a \\ntiny bit extra which adds to the profit of the company. \\n  \\n\\n \\nLikewise, managing your investments in a Mutual Fund is also a service and \\nthe service is oﬀered by the Asset Management Company (AMC), and \\nneedless to say, you have to pay for it. \\nThe fee mutual fund charges are called, ‘The Total Expense Ratio’ or TER. \\nWhy do the AMCs charge? Well, they have expenses to bear – custodian fees, \\nTrustee, RTAs, fund managers, admin, brokers, distributors, advertisements, \\nand of course, as a business, they need to be profitable too. \\nAt this point, there are two possible paths available to us – deep dive into \\nwhat, why, how of TER or get a working knowledge of TER. \\nI prefer we stick to the later. As a Mutual fund investor, all you need to be \\naware of is that mutual fund investments are not free, and you have to pay for \\nit. \\nHowever, most of the first time investors would like to believe that mutual \\nfund investments are free because they never make an explicit payment to an \\nAMC for the fund management services. In fact, no one explicitly pays an \\nAMC. \\nThe service fee, i.e. the TER is charged in a very convenient and hassle-free \\nmanner, so much so that you wouldn’t even know you’ve paid for it J. \\nAs a mutual fund investor, all you need to know is – \\n● How is the fee charged? \\n● How much is the fee charged? \\n● Techniques to save on TER. \\n  \\n \\nI’ll use a very simplified example and address these questions. The idea is to \\ngive you rough working knowledge on TER and not the exact math behind. \\nAssume a certain AMC charges a TER of 1%, i.e. a fee of Rs.1,000/- per year for \\nevery Rs.1,00,000/- invested. Now, this fee is not collected from you the \\nmoment you invest or on a monthly/quarterly/half-yearly or yearly basis. The \\nfee is collected from you daily, without even you being aware of it. \\nLet me explain – \\nRs.1,000/- is the charge on an annual basis. If you do the math, this works out \\nto – \\n1,0000/365 \\n=Rs.2.73/- \\nSo as long as you are invested, Rs.2.73/- is deducted from your funds daily. \\nThe question is, how do they charge and take this money on a daily basis. \\nAssume the starting NAV of the fund is Rs.10/-. Since you’ve invested \\nRs.1,00,000/- you are entitled to receive \\n= Rs.1,00,000/10 \\n= 10,000 units. \\nA\\x00er you invest, assume the very next day the fund gains 1%. That means, the \\nnew NAV is – \\n=10*(1+1%) \\n= 10.1 \\n  \\n \\nAnd the value of your investment is \\n= 10.1 * 10,000 \\n= Rs.1,01,000/- \\nHowever, the AMC needs Rs.2.73/- from you as a fee. Hence they will deduct \\nthis money from the value of your investment = \\nRs.1,01,000/- minus  Rs.2.73/- \\n= Rs.1,00,997.3/- \\nOr the actual NAV applicable (and declared) is – \\n= Rs.1,00,997.3 / 10,000 \\n= 10.09973. \\nNote, the NAV is 10.09973 a\\x00er deducting the TER. Before TER the NAV is 10.1. \\nSo the point to note is – ● The NAV that is declared is a\\x00er deducting the TER \\n● The money is collected from you from your investments \\n● Money is deducted daily \\nNow in the example, we worked with the assumption that the value of the \\ninvestments increases by 1%. Even if the value of the fund decreased, the \\nfund will still go ahead and charge what they are supposed to charge. \\nBesides, there are plenty of nuances to TER calculation. For instance, SEBI \\nhas mandated the maximum TER a fund can levy over an Equity and Debt \\n  \\n \\nfund. SEBI has also proposed a maximum TER proportionate to the fund \\nasset under management for a given scheme. The fund should also consider \\nthe weighted average sum of your investments. So as you can imagine, there \\nare many subtleties involved. \\nThere are professional ‘fund accounting’ companies which incorporate the \\nSEBI guidelines and help the AMCs do the math and ascertain the TER on a \\nweighted average basis. As an investor, I don’t think it is necessary to dwell \\ninto these technicalities as long as you know much you are paying. \\nAlso, when you are selecting a fund for investment, the TER is not a \\nstandalone factor to consider. TER is no doubt important, but just because a \\nfund is charging say 2%, you should not ignore everything else about the \\nfund and decide not to invest. \\nYes, if you have to shortlist between two funds of the same type including the \\nreturn profile, for example, an overnight fund, then it makes sense to look at \\nthe fund with a lower TER and invest in it. \\nNow, here is a snapshot of the UTI Core Equity fund and the TER it charges –  \\n  \\n \\nAs you can see, the fund charges 2.11% for Direct plan and 2.39% for the \\nregular plan. \\nNow the obvious question – what is the diﬀerence between direct and regular \\nplan and why two diﬀerent TER for these funds. \\n20.2 – Direct and Regular plans  If you are a 90’s kid, growing up in Bangalore, then you’d probably remember a few ice cream brands – Vadilal, Dollops, Kwality, and Joy. My favourite was \\nJoy Ice cream, not because it was any diﬀerent than Vadilal, but because the \\nJoy Ice cream factory was 500 meters from my house. \\nIt was a small factory with a little retail outlet at the factory’s entrance. At this \\nfactory-owned retail outlet, a choco bar stick was sold at Rs.14/- whereas the \\nsame was sold at Rs.18/- in a shop called ‘Anu stores’, which still is about 1km \\naway. Whenever my parents felt generous, they would give me some money \\nto buy ice creams; I’d run to the factory retail shop and pick up a couple of ice \\ncream sticks for the family. While the kids were happy with the ice cream, my \\nfolks were happy with the savings. \\n  \\n  \\nGood old days 🙂 Now, why do you think the factory sold the ice cream at Rs.14/- while Anu \\nstores sold the same ice cream at Rs.18? \\nWell, because the owner of Anu stores needed an incentive to sell Joy ice \\ncream. Without the incentive, why would anyone sell a product, right? That’s \\nthe reason Joy Ice cream as a company would mark up the price to include \\nthe shop owners incentive and sell the choco bar at Rs.18/-. \\nHowever, at the factor’s retail outlet, there is no incentive because the Joy Ice \\ncream as a company would make whatever it had to make by selling the ice \\ncream directly to the customer at Rs.14/-. \\nI suppose this is a simple business model to understand. \\nSame goes with Mutual Funds. \\nYou can choose to buy Mutual Funds in two ways – \\n  \\n \\n● From the AMC directly ● Via a distributor \\nWhen you buy a mutual fund directly from the AMC, it is called a ‘Direct’ \\ntransaction. The direct transaction is comparable to me buying the ice creme \\nfrom the factory owned retail outlet. \\nHowever, if you buy a mutual fund from a distributor, then it is comparable to \\nbuying the ice cream from Anu stores. \\nNow the seller of a regular mutual fund needs an incentive to sell the mutual \\nfund; hence the AMC marks up the TER and passes the additional TER  to the \\ndistributor and the distributor network. Hence, for any given fund, the TER or \\nthe expense ratio for a regular fund will always be higher compared to the \\ndirect fund. \\nWhich leads us to an important point – every mutual fund scheme is available \\nin two avatars or two plans – \\n● Direct Plan \\n● Regular Plan \\nWhile everything remains the same, only the TER changes. Have a look at the \\nsnapshot below; I’ve taken this from HDFC AMC website –  \\n  \\n \\nAs you can see above, we are looking at the HDFC Top 100 Fund (Growth). \\nThere are two variants available to you – Direct and regular. The first in the list \\nis the direct plan, where they have explicitly mentioned that it is a direct plan. \\nThe second in the list is the regular plan. The AMC has not explicitly \\nmentioned that it is a regular plan, but is implied. \\nThe TER for both these funds is diﬀerent. Here is the snapshot –  \\nThe TER for Direct is 1.28%, and Regular is 1.78%. The additional TER of 0.5% \\nin the regular fund is to ensure the distributor is adequately compensated for \\nselling the Mutual Fund. \\nIt is very important to comprehend the fact that the TER is paid by you, i.e. \\nthe investor to the AMC and therefore the distributor. \\nWhen you buy from the AMC directly, there is no distributor, hence no \\ndistributor commission, hence lesser TER. The lesser the TER, the higher the returns for you. \\nAt this stage, you may be clear about the fact that the TER for regular funds is \\nhigher compared to its direct counterpart. You may have also understood the \\nfact that the fund is the same – same strategy, same portfolio, same fund \\nmanager, same risk, etc., but the  TER or the expense ratio is diﬀerent. \\n  \\n \\nThe diﬀerence in TER is mainly to incentivize the Mutual fund agent or the \\nmutual fund distributor to sell the AMCs fund. You may have a couple of questions by now – \\n● Who are these ‘MF agents or distributors’ trying to convince you to buy \\nregular plans? \\n● Why would anyone opt for regular funds given that these have higher \\nTER? \\n● If the two funds are same, then why is the NAV of direct fund higher \\ncompared to the NAV of the regular fund (refer to the snapshot above) \\nThe MF agents could be your local bank manager or that annoying uncle who \\nalways turns up on Sunday mornings to try to sell some ‘financial scheme’. \\nThe distributor could be an online website as well, where you buy the mutual \\nfund yourself. \\nRegardless of who the distributor is, you need to remember that when you \\nbuy a regular MF, you are paying a higher TER fee. \\nDoes that mean buying a regular plan and paying a higher TER is bad? Well, no. \\nIf you know nothing about Mutual fund investment,  and you need help with \\nthis, then you should opt for an advisor who will advise and keep track of \\neverything on your behalf (markets, MF performance, rebalancing etc.). \\nUnder such a circumstance, it makes sense to buy a regular MF from the \\nagent to compensate him or her for the advisory work and the continuous \\nhand holding services. \\n  \\n \\nHowever, if you are comfortable dealing with Mutual funds (which hopefully \\nis the case because you are reading this module), then it does not make sense \\nto opt for a regular fund. You are better oﬀ investing in a direct fund and save \\non costs. \\nHopefully, this explains who these distributors are and why one should opt or \\nnot opt for regular funds. \\nThe last question, i.e. why the NAV of direct funds is higher compared to a \\nregular fund is perhaps the most asked question. \\nThe confusion is this – the NAV of the regular fund is lesser. Hence the units \\nare available for a cheaper price, why pay more for the direct fund given the \\nfact that the NAV for direct funds is higher. \\nFor example, look at the NAVs for HDFC Top 100 fund – \\n● Direct plan NAV is 460.5 \\n● Regular plan NAV is 438.4 \\nThe diﬀerence is almost Rs.22/- per unit. It is only natural to want to buy the \\nregular fund considering it is cheaper. \\nWell, the problem is in the way we perceive the NAV. If you look at NAV as a \\nprice you pay to acquire the mutual fund, then, yes, the regular fund NAV \\nlooks cheaper, and it seems like a  smart decision to pay a lesser amount and \\nbuy the regular plan. \\nHowever, if you look at the NAV not as an asset price, but rather as the value \\nof an asset, then you will soon realise that the regular plan is less valuable \\n  \\n \\ncompared to the direct plan. A\\x00er all, the NAV stands for ‘Net Asset Value’, and \\nnot ‘Net Asset price’, I hope you get the subtle diﬀerence 🙂 Think of NAV as of the latest value of the asset you’ve acquired. \\nIn the next chapter, we will continue to discuss a few more mutual fund \\nmetrics. \\nKey takeaways from this chapter \\n● Investment in Mutual fund is not free; there is a fee applicable. \\n● The applicable fee is called the ‘Total Expense Ratio’ or simply \\nthe expense ratio \\n● The TER is expressed as an annual percentage charged \\n● The TER is charged daily \\n● The NAV that is declared is posted TER deduction \\n● For a given fund, TER for the direct plan is lesser compared to \\nthe regular plan \\n● For a given fund, the NAV for the regular plan is always lesser \\ncompared to the direct plan     \\n  \\n \\nCHAPTER  21 \\nMutual  Benchmarking  \\n21.1 – TER savings  I probably should have discussed this in the last chapter itself, but don’t know \\nwhy (and how I missed it). While we discussed TER, Direct, and Regular plans, \\nI should have perhaps given you an indication of how much one can save by \\nopting for a direct plan. So before we discuss mutual fund benchmarking, lets \\nquickly address the savings bit. Also, this is my last attempt to convince you \\nto switch to direct MF investment as opposed to regular MF.  You can do this little experiment yourself.  Pick any Mutual fund of your choice. I’ve picked IDFC Core Equity Fund, \\nGrowth. Arbitrarily assume a starting date and a SIP amount, I’ve picked \\nRs.10,000/- as the monthly SIP amount, starting from 1st Jan 2014. I further \\nassumed that the SIP is continued over five years, i.e. till 1st Jan 2020.  I’ve used a standard SIP calculator (I’ve used the one on Moneycontrol) to see \\nthe performance of the SIP in this fund. Here is the result –    \\n\\n  \\nThere are a couple of things you will notice here –  1. The CAGR (or XIRR to be particular) is 8.84% \\n2. The total amount invested is Rs.7,30,000/- across 73 months.  3. The total number of units acquired is 20,772.43  4. The value of the investment a\\x00er 73 months of regular investment is \\nRs.9,52,000/-  This is a reasonably standard SIP performance. Now, repeat the same activity \\nwith the same fund, but in the direct option, i.e. IDFC Core Equity Fund, \\nDirect, Growth.    \\n \\nHere is how the performance looks like –   Contract the performance of the direct option with the regular option. I’ve \\ntabulated this for you so that it’s easy for you to compare –     \\n \\nIn the direct fund, you would have accumulated 19,982 units, slightly lesser \\nthan regular funds. But do recall from the previous chapter, the value of units \\nin direct funds is always much higher compared to the regular fund.  As you can see, the investment value in direct is Rs.9,99,527/- versus the value \\nof Rs.9,52,000/- in the regular fund.  The diﬀerence is Rs.47,527/- or about 6.51% when compared to the initial \\ninvestment amount. Where do you think this money is going?  Well, the money is going to the distributor for having advised you to start a \\n10,000/- SIP five years ago.  Now obviously in the direct fund, the distributor does not make this \\ncommission. Hence the returns are higher, this is quite evident when you look \\nat the XIRR as well – 10.47% Direct Fund XIRR versus Regular plan’s 8.84%.  Which implies, that every year you end up paying 1.63% of your investment \\nvalue as commissions. \\nDo yourself a favour, and please switch to direct funds 😊  \\n21.2 – Benchmarking and TRI \\nMoving forward, I guess we need to spend some time to discuss the concept \\nof ‘Benchmarking’, in mutual funds.  Benchmarking, in the mutual fund world, is used to measure the \\nperformance of a fund. To put this in perspective, think about an aspiring \\nathlete, say a runner named ‘X’. \\n  \\n \\nX is practising hard for an upcoming running event. X’s main plan is to not \\nonly win the 100 meters race but also beat ‘Y’, another aspiring runner from \\nthe neighbouring town.   Now, in the practice run, X clears the 100-meter track in 14.5 seconds. Do you \\nthink he is in a good position to win the race? \\nIt would be hard to say unless we know how much time Y takes to clear the \\nsame track, right? Assume, Y takes 13 seconds.  Now, who is likely to win the race? Y, right? \\nWe were able to answer (or predict) this because we could benchmark both X \\nand Y against each other. If we knew the speed of X or Y without knowing the \\nother person’s running speed, then we couldn’t estimate who is likely to win \\nthe race.    \\n \\nThis is called benchmarking. Benchmarking allows us to measure \\nperformance.  The same goes with Mutual Funds.  Every mutual fund sets itself against a benchmark and aims to beat that \\nbenchmark in terms of returns generated.   In the snapshot above, we can see that DSP’s Equity Opportunity Fund, \\nbenchmarks itself against the Ni\\x00y 250 Index (TRI).  For example, a large-cap equity fund benchmarks itself against the Ni\\x00y 50 \\nIndex. The idea here being that the large-cap fund should beat the index in \\nterms of returns generated on any timeframe you choose to measure – it \\ncould be 3, 5 or 10 years. In general –  1. The MF generates higher returns than the benchmark; then the fund is \\nsaid to outperform  2. The MF generates lower returns compared to the benchmark; then the \\nfund is said to have under-performed    \\n \\nTo put this in context, assume an Equity fund generates 12% CAGR across \\nthree years while its benchmark, i.e. Ni\\x00y 50 generates 10.5% for the same \\nperiod. In this case, the fund is said to have outperformed. The excess return \\nwith respect to the benchmark is called the ‘Alpha’. \\nIn this case, the Alpha is 1.5% i.e. 12% – 10.5%.  By the way, in the snapshot above, you must have noticed the ‘TRI’bit. TRI \\nstands for Total Return Index. The total return index includes and factors in \\nfor dividends as well. Remember, when you buy a stock of a company, there \\nare two sources of income –  1. Price appreciation or capital gains \\n2. Dividend income \\nNow, think about the regular index chart that all of us check. This chart \\ncaptures only the price appreciation of the index. It does not capture the \\ndividends issued by the index constituents. To get a sense of real returns an \\ninvestor earns, one has to factor in for the dividends received by the \\ncompany. The total returns index (TRI) captures this. So when we look at the \\nNi\\x00y 50 chart, we are essentially looking at just the price appreciation chart, \\nbut when we are looking at the Ni\\x00y 50 TRI, we are looking at both price \\nappreciation, and the dividends received.  Have a look at a comparison of Ni\\x00y 50 and Ni\\x00y 50 TRI, the blue line is TRI \\nand red is Ni\\x00y 50 –    \\n  \\nFor the same period, TRI has posted an absolute return of 942% while the \\nNi\\x00y 50 has posted 738%. The reason why I’m talking about this to let you \\nknow three things –  1. For an index, its TRI avatar is always more valuable since it factors in \\ndividends.  2. MF’s use TRI as a benchmark; this is a recent phenomenon though. \\nEarlier, MFs were benchmarking against just the price appreciation \\nchart.  3. It’s not easy to beat the TRI index. 😊  \\nAlright, now that we have laid a foundation for our discussion for \\nbenchmarking, let’s take this discussion a bit deeper.     \\n \\n21.3 – Weights matter \\nConsider this, there are two mutual fund managers, A & B.  A manages a large-cap fund and benchmarks his funds with Ni\\x00y 50 TRI. B \\nmanages an Equity multi opportunity fund and benchmarks his funds against \\nNi\\x00y 500 TRI.  Which mutual fund manager here do you think will have a tough time beating \\ntheir benchmark? \\nNi\\x00y 50 has 50 large-cap stock, while Ni\\x00y 500 has not only the 50 stocks from \\nNi\\x00y 50 but an additional 450 stocks.  Intuitively, it feels as if beating the Ni\\x00y 500 TRI seems like a more \\nchallenging task. A\\x00er all, Ni\\x00y 500 is diversified, has more stocks, lesser volatility, and therefore drawdowns are contained.  Well, but it’s not. The reason for this is interesting. Let me explain this.  Imagine you have created an imaginary index, call it the ‘High 5’ index. High \\nfive consists of the top 5 stocks across five diﬀerent sectors. The constituents \\nof the index are as follows –     \\n \\nEach stock has a certain weight in the index. The starting value of the index is \\n1000; the Base Split column shows you the split of 1000 according to the \\nweight of the individual stocks in the index.  With this, assume you start your index. A\\x00er a few days, the stock prices have \\nchanged, which means the index value also varies. I’ve randomly assigned \\nstock price values to the High five index stocks  –   As a virtue of the change in stock price, the individual base values change, \\nhence the entire index changes. Given the stock price changes, the overall \\nindex value changes, and as you can see, the index changed from 1000 \\n(starting price) to 1,081.72, representing an absolute return of 8.17%.  Now, let’s not change anything in the high five indexes, let the stocks remain \\nthe same, the reference stock prices will stay the same, and even the starting \\nvalue of the index remains the same. \\nWe will only change the weights assigned to individual stocks and see what \\nhappens to the index values. Have a look at the snapshot below –     \\n \\nAs you can see, the weights have changed. For example, initially, the value \\nassigned to Biocon was 10%, which is not increased to 20%, Bajaj Auto was \\nchanged to 40% from 18%. Likewise for other stocks as well.  With the change in weights, look at the new base value, that too has changed \\nfrom 1,081.72 to 1,056.51. With no shi\\x00 in stocks, but with a change in \\nweights, the returns have decreased to 5.65% from 8.17%.  What does this mean?  This means that the weights you assign to the stocks within an index matter \\nthe most. Whether you have 50 stocks or 500 stocks in the index is pointless, \\nwhat you need to look at it the weights assigned to each stock.  For example, in Ni\\x00y 500, the top 10 stock has a weightage of nearly 45%, the \\ntop 25 has a weightage close to 65%, top 50 has nearly 85-90% of the \\nweightage.  The rest 450 stocks exist, for the sake of it. 😊  \\nTo put this in a more meaningful context, do check the rolling returns of Ni\\x00y \\n50 TRI and Ni\\x00y 500 TRI.  The chart below is the 10-year rolling return of both Ni\\x00y 50 TRI and Ni\\x00y 500 \\nTRI  starting from 2005 –   \\n  \\nAnd the one below is the 5-year rolling return –   The graphs are generated by my good friend, Shyam from Stockviz.  It’s remarkable how similar these return/drawdown profiles are. There was \\nsome divergence between Ni\\x00y 50 and Ni\\x00y 500 from 2005 to 2007, but that \\nquickly disappeared. Since then the returns have been relatively similar \\n  \\n \\nacross both these indices. Again, indicating the fact that the additional 450 \\nstocks in Ni\\x00y 500 make very little diﬀerence.  While I’ve not discussed other indices such as Ni\\x00y 100 or Ni\\x00y 250, you can \\nexpect something similar.  So the question is – what diﬀerence does it make if the benchmark is Ni\\x00y 50 \\nTRI or Ni\\x00y 500 TRI?  Well, nothing.  What does this mean to you as a mutual fund investor? I suppose some of you \\nare reading this may have figured this out already.  Don’t worry too much about MF benchmarking. You as an investor, should \\ndevelop a sense of realistic return expectation from your MF investments. \\nThat realistic return expectation should serve as your benchmark for the \\ninvestment and not the one assigned by the AMC.  Everything else is noise according to me.  Naturally, this further boils down to setting realistic return expectations in \\nlife. For example, if you’ve predominantly invested in a large-cap fund, then \\nyou should expect large-cap kind of results and not small-cap kind returns. \\n😊 Having said that, if the fund you’ve invested in is under-performing the index \\nconsistently then that is not a good sign either. Under such circumstances, \\nyou may want to consider a review or even change of fund. \\nYour ability to analyse a fund and set realistic return expectations from your \\ninvestment eventually defines you as an MF investor. The focus over the next \\n  \\n \\nfew chapters will be on his, i.e. to identify your personal financial goals, build \\nan MF portfolio, and set yourself a realistic expectation.  The next chapter, we will try and conclude our discussion on Mutual fund \\nmetric and then proceed to goals and portfolios.  Stay tuned. \\nKey takeaways from this chapter \\n● Benchmarks help you get a perspective of performance. \\n● Most mutual funds benchmark themselves against TRI, which \\nis the total returns index. \\n● TRI captures the eﬀect of dividends. \\n● The returns of the index largely depend on the weights \\nassigned to each of the index constituents. \\n● TRI returns of Ni\\x00y 50, and Ni\\x00y 500 is mostly similar. \\n● You need to set realistic return expectations and set that as a \\nbenchmark.         \\n  \\n \\nCHAPTER  22 \\nMutual Fund Beta, SD, and Sharpe Ratio  \\n22.1 – Beta \\nOver the last few chapters, we discussed various attributes of a mutual fund. \\nWe will continue the same in this chapter and focus on key risk measures of a \\nmutual fund. Risk measures include various attributes such as – \\n● Beta \\n● Alpha \\n● Standard Deviation \\n● Sharpe Ratio \\nWe will start with the beta.  \\n  \\n\\n \\nOne of the key attributes of the mutual fund is the ‘beta’ of the fund. The beta \\nof a mutual fund is the measure of relative risk, expressed as number; Beta \\ncan take any value above or below zero. Beta gives us a perspective of the \\nrelative risk of the mutual fund vis a vis its benchmark. \\nI’ll not get into the details of how beta is calculated, I’ve done that in the \\nFuture’s module. Here is the link if you are interested to know the math \\nbehind – https:///chapter/hedging-futures/ \\nSection 11.5 of this chapter discusses the beta in detail. For this chapter, I’ll \\nrestrict myself to the application of beta and how you need to use this \\nnumber. Have a look at the snapshot below –  \\nI’ve captured this from Value research; these attributes belong to Tata \\nMulticap fund. As you can see, the fund is benchmarked against S&P BSE 500 \\nTRI. \\nI’ve highlighted the beta of the fund, which is 0.95. Like I mentioned earlier, \\nbeta gives us a measure of the relative risk of the fund. In general, \\nIf the beta of a mutual fund is less than 1, then the fund is perceived as less \\nrisky compared to its benchmark. For example, the Tata Multicap fund has a \\n  \\n \\nbeta of 0.95, hence the fund is slightly less risky compared to its benchmark. I \\nsay  slightly  because it’s very close to 1. This implies,  if S&P Sensex 500 falls \\nby  1%, then Tata Multicap fund is expected to fall by 0.95%. \\nIf the beta was 0.6 or 0.65, the fund is less risk or less volatile compared to its \\nbenchmark. Why? Because if S&P Sensex 500 falls by  1%, then Tata Multicap \\nfund is expected to fall by only 0.65% and not 0.95%. \\nThis is what I mean by ‘relative risk’; it gives us a perspective of how risky the \\nfund is compared to its benchmark. \\nNow, if the beta of a mutual fund is equal to 1, then it means the fund is as \\nrisky as its benchmark. For example, if the benchmark falls by 1%, the fund is \\nexpected to fall by 1%. So both the benchmark and the fund are expected to \\nhave similar risk profiles. \\nLastly, if the beta of the fund is higher than 1, it implies that the fund is risker \\ncompared to its benchmark. For instance, a beta of 1.2 suggests that the fund \\nis 20% riskier compared to its benchmark. If the benchmark falls by 1%, the \\nfund is expected to fall by 1.2%. \\nWhen you are looking at the Beta of a stock or an MF, it is very important to \\nrecognize the fact that the beta is a measure of relative risk, it tells us how \\nrisky the stock or MF is compared to its benchmark. Beta is not an indicator of \\nthe inherent risk of the stock or MF. \\nTo put this in context, think about it this way, Ferrari is faster compared to a \\nBMW, this comparison is like the beta. We measure the speed of car one against car two. But does this give you any indication of how fast the Ferrari \\nis? Not really. \\n  \\n \\nLikewise, while beta gives us a perspective of the relative riskiness of an \\nasset, it does not give us the absolute or the inherent risk of the asset itself. \\nBy now, you must have a built your perception of beta. Let me ask you this – if \\na mutual fund has a high beta, do you think it is bad? \\nWell, the good, bad, ugly part of beta depends on another metric called the \\n‘ Alpha ’. \\n22.2 – Alpha \\nIn the previous chapter, we briefly discussed alpha. We defined alpha as the excess return of the fund over and above the benchmark returns. Well, that is \\ntrue, but we need to make a few small changes to that equation and include \\nour newly introduced friend, beta. To understand alpha, we need to \\nunderstand the concept of ‘Risk-free’ return. The risk-free return is the \\nmaximum return you can generate without taking any risk. By risk I mean – \\nmarket risk, credit risk, interest rate risk, and unsystematic risk. \\nThere are two return sources which fit in the above definition  – (1) The return \\nfrom the savings bank account (2) The fixed deposit return. \\nOf course, we can argue that the banks too are not safe and come with some \\ndegree of risk. Understandable, but let’s keep that argument aside for this \\ndiscussion 😊 Or if you are a stickler for definitions, let us stick to the treasury bills, issued \\nby the Govt of India. The treasury bills have an implicit sovereign so it's \\ndeemed safe. \\n  \\n  \\nThe T bill rates as of today are roughly about 3.75%, and let us keep 4% for \\nconvenience. \\nAlpha is defined as the excess return of the mutual fund over the benchmark \\nreturn,  on a risk-adjusted basis. \\nRisk-adjusted basis means we need to – ● Calculate the diﬀerence between the mutual fund returns and the \\nrisk-free return ● Calculate the diﬀerence between the benchmark return and the \\nrisk-free return, multiply this by the beta \\n● Take the diﬀerence between 1 and 2 \\nMathematically, \\nAlpha = (MF Return – risk free return) – (Benchmark return – risk free \\nreturn)*Beta \\n  \\n \\nLet's put this in context with an example. Assume a certain fund gives you a \\nreturn of 10%, its benchmark returns for the same duration is 7%. The beta of \\nthe fund is 0.75. What do you think of the alpha assuming the risk-free rate is \\n4%? \\nLet’s apply the for formula and check – \\nAlpha = (10%-4%)-(7%-4%)*0.75 \\n= 6% – 2.25% \\n= 3.75% \\nAs you can see, the alpha is not just the diﬀerence between the fund and its \\nbenchmark, which if true, the alpha would have been – \\n10% – 7% \\n=3% \\nBut rather, the alpha is 3.75%. \\nNow, many of you may not find this intuitive. You may question where the \\nadditional 0.75% comes from. \\nWell, think about it, the fund has managed to generate a 10% return \\ncompared to the Index’s 7% while managing to stay significantly less volatile \\n(remember beta is just 0.75). Hence we are rewarding the fund for its good \\nbehaviour or less volatile behaviour. Therefore the alpha is 3.75% as opposed \\nto just 3%. \\nNow, imagine the same fund, with the same returns, but the beta is 1.3 \\ninstead of 0.75. What do you think is the alpha? \\n  \\n \\nBy now, you should guess that since the beta is high, the fund gets penalised \\nfor its erratic behaviour. Therefore the alpha should be lower. \\nLet us see if the numbers agree to this thought. \\nAlpha = (10%-4%)-(7%-4%)*1.3 \\n= 6% – 3.9% \\n= 2.1% \\nSee that? While the returns remain the same, thanks to beta, the alpha is \\nsignificantly lesser on a risk-adjusted basis. \\nTo conclude, alpha is the excess return of the fund over above the benchmark \\nreturns. Alpha is risk-adjusted. The fund is rewarded if the returns are \\ngenerated by keeping a low-risk profile and penalized for being volatile. \\nBy now, you must have realized that volatility plays an important role in \\nmeasuring mutual funds performance. Beta is a measure of volatility; it tells \\nus how risky the fund is when compared to its benchmark. Beta is a relative \\nrisk and does not reveal the fund’s inherent risk. \\nThe inherent risk of a fund is revealed by the ‘Standard Deviation’ of the fund. \\n22.3 – Standard Deviation (SD) \\nI’ve explained the concept of ‘Standard Deviation’ in details here – \\nhttps:///chapter/understanding-volatility-part-1/ \\nI’d suggest you go through that entire chapter to understand the concept of \\nstandard deviation and volatility. This will help you not just in your MF \\ninvestments, but also investments in stocks. \\n  \\n \\nI’ll take the liberty of skipping the explanation of standard Deviation since it's \\nalready explained. However, if you are in no mood to read an entire chapter \\nto figure out the standard Deviation, then here is your shortcut – \\n● The standard deviation of a stock or a mutual fund represents the \\nriskiness of the stock or the mutual fund \\n● Standard Deviation is a percentage, expressed as an annualised figure \\n● Higher the standard Deviation, higher is the volatility of the asset. \\nHigher the volatility, higher is the risk. \\nFor example, consider these two funds –  \\nI’ve taken the snapshot from Value research. The funds under consideration \\nare the Axis Small-cap fund and Axis long term equity. \\nThe SD of the small-cap fund is 23.95% while the long term equity is 19.33%, \\nwhich implies that the small-cap fund is way riskier compared to the long \\nterm equity fund. \\nTo put this context, if you invest Rs.10,000/- across funds at the same time, \\nthen by the end of the year the profit or loss can be anywhere in this range –  \\n  \\n \\nLoss = Investment * (1-SD) \\nGains = Investment * (1+SD) \\nThe larger the SD, the larger the possibility of loss or gains. \\nGenerally speaking, the SD for mid and small-cap funds are higher compared \\nto large-cap stocks. \\nDo note, volatility or Standard Deviation should not worry you. Markets are \\nvolatile, and equities are volatile, mutual funds are volatile; this is the very \\nnature of markets. So if you can’t fathom watching your investment see-saw \\nbetween gains and loss, then perhaps you should reconsider your investment \\ndecision inequities. \\nBut if you do invest in equities, then you need to learn to manage volatility. \\nThere are two ways to deal with this beast called ‘Volatility’ – \\n● Diversify smartly (and not over diversify) \\n● Give your investment time \\nI think that time is the ultimate antidote against volatility. Give your \\ninvestments time, and time will take care of volatility. All along with this \\nmodule, I’ve stressed the importance of giving your MF investments time, and \\nthis is the reason why I’ve stressed on it. \\nAnyway, while at it, check the Alpha and Beta of both these funds. Few \\nobservations – \\n  \\n \\n● The beta of both the funds is sub 1, which means compared to their \\nbenchmark they are relatively less risky. But how risky are they \\nindividually? We can answer this by looking at the SD \\n● Alpha is a positive number for both the funds, which is a good thing. \\nThe Alpha for Axis small-cap fund is quite impressive. I’d guess this is \\nbecause of the low beta factor plus the low risk-free return prevailing in \\nthe economy. \\nI hope the risk parameters are starting to make sense to you. We will now shi\\x00 \\nfocus to another parameter called the ‘Sharpe Ratio’. \\n22.4 – Sharpe Ratio \\nSharpe Ratio is one of the most sacred formulas in Finance. It was invented \\nby Willam F Sharpe, an American Economist in the year in 1966. He was \\nawarded the Nobel prize in 1990 for his work on the Capital asset pricing \\nmodel. \\nAssume, there are two large-cap funds -Fund A and Fund B. Here is how they \\nhave performed in terms of returns – \\nFund A – 14% \\nFund B – 16% \\nWhich of the two funds are better? Well, Fund B has a higher return, so \\nwithout a doubt, Fund B is a better fund. \\nNow, consider the following – \\n  \\n  \\nRf is the risk-free return. Along with the fund’s return, I’ve also stated the \\nstandard deviation/volatility/risk of the two funds. Now, which of the two \\nfunds do you think is better? \\nI guess it gets a little complex to figure out which these two funds are better \\ngiven that we have to evaluate them on two parameters, i.e. both the risk and \\nreturn. \\nIgnoring the risk, purely on a return basis, Fund B is better. Ignoring the \\nreturn, purely on a risk basis, Fund A is better. But in reality, you cannot \\nisolate risk and reward; you need to factor in both these and figure out which \\nof these two are better. \\nThe Sharpe Ratio helps us here. It bundles the concept of risk, reward, and \\nthe risk-free rate and gives us a perspective. \\nSharpe ratio = [Fund Return – Risk-Free Return]/Standard Deviation of \\nthe fund \\nLet's apply the math for Fund A – \\n= [14% – 6%] / 28% \\n= 8%/28% \\n= 0.29 \\n  \\n \\nThe number tells us that the fund generates 0.29 units of return (over and \\nabove the risk-free return) for every unit of risk undertaken. Naturally, by this \\nmeasure, the higher the Sharpe ratio, the better it is as we all want higher \\nreturns for every unit of risk undertaken. \\nLets see how this turns out for Fund B – \\n= [16% – 6% ] / 34% \\n= 10% / 34% \\n= 0.29 \\nSo it turns out that both the funds are similar in terms of their risk and reward \\nperspective. And there is no advantage of choosing Fund A over Fund B. \\nNow, instead of 34% standard deviation, assume Fund B’s standard Deviation \\nis 18%. \\n[16% – 6% ] / 18% \\n= 10% / 18% \\n= 0.56 \\nIn this case, Fund B is a better choice because Fund B generates more return \\nfor every unit of risk undertaken. \\nDo note, Sharpe ratio considers only price based risk. It does not consider \\ncredit or interest rate risk. Hence, there is no point looking at the Sharpe ratio \\nfor debt funds. \\n  \\n \\nIn the next chapter, I’ll discuss the Sortino’s ratio and the Capture ratios and \\nconclude our discussion on Mutual Fund risk parameters and then shi\\x00 focus \\non building Mutual Fund portfolios. \\nAnd I promise I’ll put up the next chapter quickly 😊 Key takeaways from this chapter \\n● Beta measures the relative risk of the fund compared to its \\nbenchmark \\n● Higher the beta, higher is the relative risk \\n● Beta is not an indicator of the inherent risk of the fund \\n● Alpha is the excess return over and above the benchmark \\nreturn on a risk-adjusted basis \\n● Higher the beta, lower is the alpha and vice versa \\n● The standard Deviation measures the riskiness of the fund. \\nHigher the SD, higher is the volatility of the fund \\n● Share ratio measures the unit of return earned for every unit \\nof risk undertaken \\n● Higher the Sharpe ratio, better is the fund.       \\n  \\n \\nCHAPTER  23        Sortino and the Capture Ratios  \\n23.1 – The Sortino’s Ratio \\nIn this chapter, we will discuss two other ratios related to the mutual fund \\nperformance/risk measures, i.e. the Sortino Ratio and the Capture Ratios. \\nThese are fairly easy to understand, so we will try to keep this chapter as a \\nshort note. \\nWe discussed the Sharpe Ratio in the previous chapter. The formula, if you remember looks like this – \\nSharpe ratio = [Fund Return – Risk-Free Return]/Standard deviation of the \\nfund \\nI want you to think about the denominator. The denominator has ‘Standard \\nDeviation’, which, as you know, is an assessment of risk. What sort of risk? \\nWell, we are talking about the risk of the returns varying from the average \\nexpected returns. Read that line again; we are defining risk as to the variation \\n(or the variance) from the average expected returns. The variance can be both \\npositive or negative. \\nLet me explain, have a look at the image below – \\n  \\n\\n  \\nThis is the sample daily NAV data for a Mutual fund. I’ve calculated the daily \\nreturn for the fund for the time series, and I’ve also calculated the average \\ndaily return for the time series. \\nThe average return is 0.108%. \\nFurther, I calculate the excess return by subtracting the average return from \\nthe actual return. For example, the daily return for 4th August 2020 was \\n1.23%, the average return is 0.108%. \\nHence, Excess Return – \\n= 1.23% – 0.108% \\n= 1.13%. \\n  \\n \\nOf course, you square this return to get the variance, from which you further \\ncalculate the standard deviation or the risk. \\nThe point that I want to make here is that when you take the excess return, \\nyou get both positive and negative values. A positive value indicates a profit \\nand negative value indicates a loss. \\nNow, let us look at the Sharpe ratio again – \\nSharpe ratio = [Fund Return – Risk-Free Return]/Standard deviation of the \\nfund \\nBy, using the ‘standard deviation’ in the denominator, we try to adjust the \\nreturns per unit of risk. However, the risk contains both positive and negative \\nreturns. \\nA\\x00er all, we do not want to penalize the fund for a positive return; we need to \\nscrutinize it for only the negative returns. \\nThe Sortino’s ratio helps in this regard. \\nThe Sortino’s ratio is an improvisation over the Sharpe Ratio, wherein the \\ndenominator has only the negative returns or the ‘downside risk’, is \\nconsidered. \\nHence, the Sortino’s Ratio is – \\n= [Fund Return – Risk-Free Return]/Downside Risk \\nThe objective of Sortino’s ratio is to estimate the excess return adjusted for \\nonly the downside risk. Like the Sharpe ratio, higher the Sortino’s ratio, better \\nit is. \\n  \\n \\nApart from this one change, there is not much diﬀerence between the Sharpe \\nand Sortino’s Ratio. \\n23.2 – Capture Ratios \\nI find the capture ratios very interesting. In my opinion, the capture ratios \\novershadow all other metrics and get straight to the point. \\nBefore I discuss these capture ratios, let me tell you a quick story from my \\ncollege days. \\nWe were a group of friends in the first year of Engineering; we were young, \\nrestless, and misguided in life. 😊 We were about 8-10 of us, always moved around in a group. Played cricket all \\nday long, missed classroom sessions, and would sit in the parking lot \\nspending hours talking about useless things in life. I must agree; it was a lot of \\nfun 😊 . \\nSo much fun that we at times ignored exams around the corner, to the extent \\nthat most of us would barely manage to get a passing mark. \\nBut there was this one guy in the group who was a little diﬀerent. He would \\nspend time with the rest of the gang, hang out, chit chat, play cricket, and go \\nback home late. He would have all the fun the entire group had. However, \\naround exam time, he would go back home to study and managed to do \\nbetter than the rest of the group.  Not that he scored great marks, but he \\ncertainly did better than the rest of us.     \\n  \\nAnd we would all wonder how this guy did it. Sounds typical right? I’m sure \\nmany of you reading this may have come across similar situations in your \\ncollege life. \\nBut why am I telling you this story? Well, there is a reason for it. \\nPlease think about this smart friend of mine. While he had 100% of the fun \\nwith the group, he knew when to cut the slack. He knew it was too risky to not \\nstudy for the exams. \\nIt may sound weird, but let’s extend this to mutual funds. Imagine this friend \\nof mine as a mutual fund and the rest of us as the mutual fund’s benchmark. \\nWhen the group (or the benchmark) was having fun (or let’s say generating \\npositive returns), so did this friend of mine(the mutual fund) to his full \\ncapacity. \\nWhen it was time to study, the group (benchmark) suﬀered (think of it as a \\nnegative return), but this friend had good risk management practise, he \\nscored better than the group. \\n  \\n \\nIf we were to summarize his performance, he had max fun, but managed risk \\nwell, and fared slightly better than the rest. \\nThe summary is nothing but the ‘Capture Ratio’. \\nThe capture ratio tells us, for a given period, to what extent did the fund \\ncapture the positive returns of its benchmark and also to what extent it \\ncaptured the negative returns from the benchmark. \\nHere is an example –  \\nThis is the capture ratio of HDFC Top 100, Direct, Growth fund on a 3-year \\nbasis. I’ve taken this from Morningstar India website. \\nThe fund has an upside capture ratio of 99, which implies that the fund has \\nmanaged to capture 99% of the Index’s up move. \\nLikewise, the downside capture ratio is 119, which means that the fund has \\ncaptured 119% of the downside returns of the Index. \\nThe math behind capture ratio is elementary, but I’ll skip that since as an \\ninvestor, you’d not need it. \\nAll I want you to remember is that the upside capture ratio conveys the extent \\nto which the fund captures all the positive returns of its benchmark. The \\ndownside capture ratio indicates the extent to which the fund captures (or \\nrather avoided) the negative returns of its benchmark. \\n  \\n \\nGiven this, ask yourself, what should be the ideal capture ratio of a mutual \\nfund? Well, we would want the fund which captures 100% of the upside if not \\nmore. At the same time, we would want the downside capture ratio to be as \\nlow as possible. \\nWell, this is not easy 😊 A fund will either have a great upside or a great downside capture ratio, but \\nnot both. \\nA fund either has a great upside capture ratio along with a disappointing \\ndownside capture (like this HDFC fund) or you will find the other way round, \\nwhere the upside capture is low and so is the downside capture. \\nCheck this –  \\nThis is the capture ratio for the Parag Parikh Long term equity fund on a \\n3-year basis. While the upside is not impressive at all, the downside capture \\nratio is quite impressive. \\nSo the point is that it is always a trade-oﬀ. You, as an investor, need to be \\nclear on this – do you want the fund to be aggressive in chasing returns or do \\nyou want the fund to have a great risk management practice? \\nI prefer to look at the latter. I like funds which manage the risk better, and I \\nevaluate this by looking at the consistency of the downside capture ratio, \\nover many years. \\n  \\n \\nIf you look at HDFC Top 100, Regular Growth fund, the downside capture ratio \\nof 3, 5, and 10 years are 120, 119, and 111 respectively. I like the consistency \\nin risk management here, and I’d value this far higher than the upside capture \\nratio. \\nBy the way, the 3, 5, and 10 year upside capture ratio is 98, 103, 104 for the \\nsame fund, which is not bad at all. Also, it does not matter if you choose to \\nanalyse the upside or downside capture ratio; what matters is the \\nconsistency. Hence it’s important to look at capture ratios across multiple \\nyears. \\nI usually check the capture ratios on the Morningstar India website. I’m not \\nsure if these ratios are listed anywhere else. \\nAnd with this and everything else we have discussed in the previous chapter, I \\nhope you’ve got a sense of all the diﬀerent mutual fund metrics. \\nThe next few chapters will focus on analyzing a mutual fund and building a \\nmutual fund portfolio for specific financial goals. \\nStay tuned. \\nKey takeaways from this chapter \\n● Sharpe ratio measures the return per unit of risk by \\nconsidering both the positive and negative returns \\n● Sortino’s modifies the Sharpe ratio and includes just the \\ndownside risk \\n  \\n \\n● Upside capture ratio gives you an estimate of how much of the \\nIndex’s upside the fund has captured \\n● Downside capture ratio gives you an estimate of how much of \\nthe Index’s downside returns the fund has captured. \\n● Look for consistency in capture ratio                        \\n  \\n  \\nCHAPTER  24 \\nHow to analyse an Equity  Mutual  Fund  \\n24.1 – Recap \\nI’d like you to take a moment and reflect upon the last 23 chapters in this \\nmodule. I want you to recap the things we have discussed so far mentally. \\nIn a nutshell, here is what we have discussed – \\n○ Identified that investment is a key part of personal finance \\n○ Identified various assets which can help us move closer to our \\nretirement goals or any other financial goals \\n○ Figured that Mutual funds are the primary financial instrument \\nwhich will help us plan our financial goals better \\n○ A\\x00er establishing the above, we figured that it is important to \\nfocus and learn more about mutual funds \\n○ We started by understanding what a mutual fund is followed by \\nthe importance of the mutual fact sheet \\n○ We identified the most popular categories of mutual funds and \\ndiscussed the same \\n○ In the process, we explored various types of funds across both \\nequity and debt categories \\n○ Discussed the Index fund \\n  \\n\\n \\n○ Most recently, we discussed the various performance and risk \\nattributes of mutual funds. \\nWe are now at an interesting junction as we steer our way to the final leg of \\nthis module, i.e. to figure ways to build mutual fund portfolios to help us \\nachieve various financial goals in our lives. \\nIf you think about it, building a mutual fund portfolio has three parts to it – \\n1. Identify a financial goal (it can be any) and translate that \\nfinancial goal in terms of time and corpus. For example here is a \\nfinancial goal – 40 lakh (in today’s terms) for my 10-year-old kid’s \\nPost-graduation degree in the US.  If you break this down, it \\ntranslates to a requirement of Rs.40L (adjusted to inflation) in 15 \\nyears \\n2. Identification of funds to help you achieve the financial goal \\n3. Periodic review and maintenance of the portfolio. \\nIn my view, the first and third point is fairly easy. It’s the 2nd point, i.e. the \\nactual act of building a portfolio is the tricky bit. If you isolate just the 2nd \\npoint, then you will realize that it is made up three things – \\n○ Analyze funds, pick the right ones and avoid investing in the bad \\nones \\n○ Figure the portfolio composition – just equity, just debt, a mix of \\nequity and debt etc. \\n  \\n \\n○ Once the portfolio is identified, figure how much to invest across \\neach of these funds Again, in my view, one of the key elements is the fund analysis. You need to \\nget this right and ensure that you have partnered with the right fund house \\nand the right fund to help you achieve the financial goal you’ve set aside. \\nIn this chapter, we will discuss a simple technique using which you can \\nanalyze an equity mutual fund. Think of this as a template; you can apply the \\nsame to all equity funds. Of course, there is no right or wrong technique; what \\nI discuss below is from my own experience.  You can develop your template as \\nyou gain more experience with mutual fund investing. \\nSo let us get started. \\n24.2 – Hygiene check  \\n  \\n \\nI’ll pick an Equity mutual fund and set out the process to analyze the fund. As \\nI mentioned, there is no guided path to analyze a mutual fund. You need to \\ndevelop your method to do that. While few investors like to focus heavily on \\nthe fund manager and the quality of stocks the fund manager has picked, \\nothers like to look at only the historical returns. \\nI like to keep the process simple and stick to things that I’m most concerned \\nabout, i.e. the fund’s ability to manage risk and generate returns. \\nAlright, so let us get started on fund analysis. \\nFor the sake of this discussion, I’ve picked the Kotak Standard Multi-Cap Fund \\n(Growth, Regular). Do not treat this as a recommendation of any sort 😊 Remember, direct funds are relatively new and may not have the necessary \\nhistorical information; hence we are looking at the regular funds. \\nThe first step is to run a few basic hygiene checks, which includes some of the \\ngood to know information about the fund. Usually, this information is \\navailable in the fund’s fact sheet. The first thing to note is ‘about the fund \\nitself’, take a look at the snapshot below –  \\n  \\n \\nFrom the note above, I develop an orientation for this fund – \\n○ It’s a multi-cap fund, which means the fund can invest across various categorizations. \\n○ Since it’s a multi-cap fund, I’d expect the fund benchmark itself \\nagainst a diversified index, which means Ni\\x00y 50 TRI may not be \\nits benchmark \\n○ I look at the fund’s inception date, in this case, its 11th Sept 2009, \\nso not a very old fund, but old enough to give me ten years of \\nhistory. \\n○ The fund manager has remained the same, which is fine. If you \\nbelong to the fund manager cult, then you can dig deeper into \\nwho the fund manager is, his background, credentials, track \\nrecord etc. I prefer to skip that bit. \\nI dig further in the fact sheet and get other important information about the \\nfund – \\n  \\n  \\nYou can read through the investment objective, you will get valuable insights \\nfrom this at times, especially when looking at debt funds. You will figure that \\nthis fund is not restricted to any particular market capitalization. The \\ninvestment style grid suggests that the fund can invest across the market and \\nhas a blended approach to growth and value style investing. \\nIf you dig up the portfolio details, you will figure that the fund has the \\nmajority of its investment in large and mid-cap stocks. Given this, the \\nbenchmark for this fund is Ni\\x00y 200 Total Return Index, which is fine. \\nI know many MF investors dig into the portfolio details and start to sweat over \\nwhy the fund manager has invested ‘x’ amount in Stock A versus ‘y’ amount in \\nstock B, and in the process, think they carry out ‘a through’ mutual fund \\nresearch. \\n  \\n \\nNitpicking on the  Equity  fund’s portfolio is not research. I mean, think about \\nit, if you could figure out which is a good stock and which is not, then you \\nmay as well invest in the stock directly right? \\nThis is as good as sitting on your couch with a tub of popcorn and passing \\nserious, opinionated comments on how Virat Kohli should bat in International \\ncricket. \\nAnyway, the fund has an AUM of Rs.29,500 Cr, which makes it a large fund. \\nFrom the AMC perspective, how large is this fund? To figure that out, you need \\nto look at AMC's overall AUM.  \\nThe AUM information is updated on the AMC website regularly. As you can \\nsee, Kotak AMC has an AUM of 1.5L Crore, which makes the standard equity \\nfund about 18% of the overall AUM. \\nHowever, suppose you look at the Equity category. In that case, the AUM is \\nabout 40,000 Crore, which means the Kotak Standard Equity Fund is nearly \\n72% of the category AUM, which implies that this is one of their flagship funds \\nfor the category. \\n  \\n \\nWhy are we digging into this information? Well, we need to know how the \\nfund is positioned within the AMC to get a perspective. It is also expected that \\nthe AMC would be extra cautious not to mess up their flagship funds. \\nWhile at it, do you think funds with large AUM is a problem?. I know many \\nfolks fret about the ‘large AUM’ problem, the rationale being that the fund \\nmanager may find it diﬀicult to manage the funds as the opportunity shrinks. \\nIf the fund flow is steady and the AUM increases gradually over time, then, in \\nmy opinion, it should be ok. However, if there is a drastic increase in AUM, \\nmaybe because of aggressive marketing campaigns, then that could be a \\nproblem and usually results in a slight lag in the performance. \\nSmaller funds do have an advantage in terms of nimbleness. \\nApart from the  AUM size, we look at the expense ratio of the fund, direct is at \\n0.73% and regular is at 1.69%. Not surprising at all 😊 Since you are reading this,  I hope you won’t consider regular funds ever again \\nin your lif e 😊 Moving ahead, I’d like you to look at a few other metrics, these are reported in \\nthe factsheet and also on 3rd party websites like Morningstar and Value \\nResearch. \\nThe snapshot below is from Morningstar. \\n  \\n  \\nThe fund’s standard deviation (on a 3-year basis) is 20.58%; this suggests the \\nfund can fluctuate 20.58% up or down over a 3-year basis. The standard \\ndeviation of the category is 21.38%. If you look at it from a risk perspective, \\nthis is nice since it indicates that the fund is slightly better compared to the \\ncategory. \\nIf you switch to the 5 and 10 years period, the fund’s SD is 18.39% and \\n17.42%, while the category’s SD is 19.12% and 18.4% respectively. For now, \\nthis is a good sign as it hints that the fund is good at managing the risk. \\nDo look at the Sharpe ratio as well. In this case, the Sharpe ratio is negative, \\nwhich means either the risk-free return is higher compared to the portfolio’s \\nreturn or the portfolio’s expected returns are negative. Either way, this is not \\nconclusive. Hence we can ignore the Sharpe ratio. \\nCheck the Alpha and the beta of the fund to get a sense of the fund's \\nperformance compared to the category. Of course, you need to do this across \\n3, 5, and 10 year periods. \\nUsually, the fund’s hygiene check ends at this point. All that we do in this \\nstage is to gather a few important ‘good to know’ data points.  \\n  \\n \\n24.3 – Rolling returns check \\nYou must have heard the line ‘past performance is not an indicator of the \\nfuture performance’, while this is true, there is no better alternative to this. By \\nstudying the past returns and its behaviour, we would at least know what to \\nexpect. \\nBy past returns, I don’t mean 1,3,6 or 12 months returns. In fact, in my opinion, anything less than three years return is pointless when it comes to \\nEquity returns. Three years itself is an ok time frame, I’d suggest five years or \\nhigher, but three years is a good start. \\nWe start by looking at the rolling returns. By the way, I hope you know what \\nrolling returns mean, else I’d suggest  you look at the chapter  and familiarize \\nyourself with the same. \\nI’ll post a series of rolling return snapshots sourced from Rupeevest website. \\nHopefully, soon we will have Rolling returns of funds on Coin, our mutual \\nfund platform. \\nHere is the three-year rolling return of the Kotak Standard Multi cap fund – \\n  \\n  \\nAs you can see, I’ve got the 3-year rolling return from Sept 2012. The blue line \\nis the fund’s three-year rolling return, and the grey is the benchmark’s rolling \\nreturn. \\nThe first thing that will catch your attention is the spread between the two \\nrolling returns. The blue line is consistently above the grey line, indicating \\nthat the fund has delivered better returns compared to its benchmark. \\nIn the three years, the fund has delivered an average return of 15.2% while \\nthe benchmark has delivered 9.87%. \\nThe moment you see such an outperformance, rather than getting excited, \\nyou need to pause and ask yourself – how is this fund pulling this oﬀ. Is the \\nfund taking in more risk compared to its benchmark? \\nWe will figure that out soon. While the spread between the fund and its benchmark was significant in the \\ninitial years, it has shrunk since mid-2018. \\n  \\n \\nIs the fund losing its sheen? One probable reason for this could be the rapid \\nrise in its AUM. \\nApart from average returns, look at the minimum and maximum returns to \\nget a perspective on the dispersion of returns. \\nThe fund’s 3-year min and max is -5.19% and +31.2%, and the benchmark’s \\nmin and max are –  6.97% and +23.53% respectively. This fund stands \\nimpressive at this point. \\nIt is important to understand that you are looking at the 3-year data, but just \\nthe 3-years data is not suﬀicient for analyzing an Equity mutual fund, we need \\nto look at five and 10-year data as well to get a perspective. \\nHere is the 5-year rolling return of the fund and we compare that to its \\nbenchmark, the Ni\\x00y 200  –  \\nAgain, on a 5-year basis, the fund’s outperformance to the benchmark is quite \\nimpressive. While the fund’s average is +16.51%, the benchmark is +10.46%. \\nNote, this is still very similar to the 3-year data. \\n  \\n \\nThe dispersion in returns when looked at the minimum and maximum \\nreturns are also quite interesting. The fund’s minimum is still a positive 1.18% \\nwhile the benchmark is -2.28%. \\nHowever, the spread has narrowed down towards the extreme right, similar \\nto how it does for the 3-year rolling return. \\nLastly, let us see how the fund performs on a 10-year rolling return basis. \\nNote, there may not be many data points for the 10 years –  \\nThe average 10-year rolling return is 12.07% versus the benchmark’s 7.48%, \\nquite remarkable in my opinion. While the fund’s minimum is 8.59%, the \\nbenchmark’s minimum is 3.79%. On the positive returns side, the fund has \\nput up an impressive 14.56% versus the benchmark’s 9.67%. \\nBased on the rolling return data, there are a few apparent things – \\n● Why is the spread shrinking? Is the fund losing its sheen? ● While the returns are impressive, is this coming at the cost of higher \\nrisk? \\n  \\n \\nThe answer to the first question is tricky. There is no fund manager change, so \\nits unlikely the investment style has changed. Is this because the fund has a \\nlarge AUM? Well, this is a tough call to make, but my gut says this could as \\nwell be the reason. \\nHave a look at the trailing returns as on date –  \\nWe can see the fund has underperformed the benchmark on a 3-year basis, \\nwhile it is at par on a 5-year basis, and on the 10-year basis, it still has a slight \\noutperformance. \\nAll in all, it gives me a perspective that the returns were great in the past \\nyears, but will that continue is the question. However, the interesting bit that \\nthe performance has been better than its peers look at the Equity Multi cap \\ncategory performance. \\nAs far as the 2nd concern goes, let us focus on the risk metrics of the fund, \\nperhaps the most crucial bit of our analysis. \\n24.4 – Risk – Return matrix check \\nI find the risk-reward matrix published by Morningstar quite useful. Have a \\nlook at this – \\n  \\n  \\nI can choose to view this across the 3, 5, and 10 years period. I've been \\nselected for five years. \\nThe initial bit highlights the fund’s risk versus the category and the fund’s \\nreturn versus the category. We know the returns have been great, so no point \\nlooking at it again. Risk versus the category risk is ‘below average’, so that’s \\nencouraging. For more details, I now look at the matrix. \\nThe Y-axis of this matrix is returned, and the X-axis is the risk. If you have read \\nVarsity’s Module 9 on ‘Risk Management’, then this matrix is already familiar \\nto you. If not, all you need to know is that the higher you move on the Y-axis, \\nhigher is the return, and the further you traverse on the X-axis, higher is the \\nrisk. \\n  \\n \\nAnyway, ignore the blue and yellow button and start with the red square, \\nwhich is right at the centre of the matrix. The red square belongs to the \\nbenchmark, and from its positioning in the matrix, we can conclude the \\nbenchmark has generated a return of 10% by taking the risk of 19%. \\nNow, look at the yellow button; it belongs to the category. We can see that the \\nyellow button is on the same vertical plane as the red square. Hence we can \\nconclude that the average category risk is similar to that of the benchmark’s \\nrisk, i.e. 19%. \\nUnfortunately, for 19% risk, the category’s return does not match upto its \\nbenchmark, as it is slightly below the benchmark’s return. \\nSo if you were to choose an investment between the category and its \\nbenchmark, it does not make sense to invest in the category since for similar \\nrisk, the benchmark oﬀers better returns. \\nWhat about the fund in perspective? \\nWell, the fund has a better risk-reward ratio compared to the benchmark. It \\nseems to have generated similar returns like the benchmark by taking on \\nlesser risk, which in my opinion is good. \\nRemember, you are paying the fund manager for active management. Active \\nmanagement does not necessarily mean generating better than benchmark \\nreturn. I think  job is well done if the fund manager can generate similar \\nreturns like the benchmark by taking on lesser risk (at a lower cost hopefully). \\nSo on a 5-year mark, this is looking good. Shi\\x00ing gear to the 10-year window \\n– \\n  \\n  \\nIt gets a bit more impressive on a ten-year basis, while the category and \\nbenchmark have a similar risk-return profile (18% risk, 12% return), the fund \\nhas slightly lesser risk and higher return profile. \\nSo at this point, I know that the fund has exhibited a decent track record in \\nterms of risk and reward profile. As the last step, let us look at the capture \\nratios. \\n24.5 – Capture ratios \\nWe discussed the capture ratios in the previous chapter. I hope you are \\nfamiliar with it by now. Here is the capture ratio on a 5-year basis – \\n  \\n  \\nLook at the downside capture ratio; the fund has managed to capture 90% of \\nthe fund’s downside, which is good. Again, this a reflection of better risk \\nmanagement at the fund house. \\nThe capture ratio gets better on a 10-year basis –  \\nThe fund has captured almost 100% of the benchmark’s return while \\ncapturing only 87% of the benchmark’s downside returns. Contrast this to the \\ncategory. \\nAll in all, our quick analysis shows that Kotak Standard Multi-cap fund is \\ngood. Does that mean you should invest in it right away? Well, we will discuss \\nthis next chapter. \\nLastly, I want you to recognize the fact that we have not looked at fund \\n‘ranking’ given out by agencies. Looking at fund ranking to make an \\ninvestment decision is quite useless since you can do a better job yourself.    \\n  \\n \\nKey takeaways from this chapter \\n● You can start the equity mutual fund research with a \\nbasic hygiene check to familiarize yourself with the fund \\n● Know the size of the AUM, its investment objectives, a bit \\nabout the fund manager, and its benchmark \\n● Look for the rolling returns of the fund on 3,5 and 10-year \\nbasis. \\n● Look for the average, minimum, and the maximum \\nreturns to get a sense of the dispersion of the return \\n● Compare the rolling returns with its benchmark rolling \\nreturns \\n● If there is excess return, check if this is coming at the cost \\nof additional risk \\n● Look for the risk-reward matrix and understand the \\nrisk-reward profile on 5 and 10 years basis \\n● Check the capture ratios   \\n  \\n \\nCHAPTER  25 \\nHow to analyse a Debt  Mutual  Fund?  \\n25.1 – Confused Portfolio \\nIn the previous chapter, we picked up an equity fund (Kotak Standard Multi \\ncap Fund) and looked at the steps to analyze an Equity fund. The idea was to \\nhighlight the steps involved in analyzing an equity mutual fund. Of course, \\ntowards the end of the previous chapter, we also figured that the fund was \\nindeed good, especially when it comes to risk management. \\nThe question is – since the fund is good, should you invest in the fund and \\ninclude it in your mutual fund portfolio? \\nWhile on the face of it, it appears like a no brainer, we've analyzed the fund \\nacross both risks and return parameters. The fund ticks oﬀ well on all the \\ngood qualities, so it makes sense to invest. \\nHowever, the decision to invest in a fund (and therefore include it in your \\nportfolio) should not stem from how good or bad the fund is. The decision to invest in a fund should come from the objective of your \\nmutual fund portfolio. Remember, the objective serves a financial goal. Now, \\nfor example, if my financial goal is to build an emergency corpus, then \\ninvesting in Equity funds may not make sense. So it does not matter how \\ngood the fund is, there is no question of investing. \\n  \\n\\n \\nFor many, asking them not to invest in a good mutual fund may come across \\na counter-intuitive thought. \\nTo put this in a layman’s context, think about Dolo 650, we all agree that it's a \\ngood paracetamol. Now just because it’s a good tablet, would you take it if \\nyou have knee pain?  \\nNo right? It makes sense to take a specific tablet which addresses your knee \\npain. \\nLikewise, an investment should be made only when the portfolio’s objective \\nand the fund’s risk-reward profile matches. In case, you do not follow this \\napproach of aligning the two; then you will most likely end up with a \\n‘confused portfolio’. \\nOver the next few chapters, we will discuss how to align funds with portfolio \\ngoals, but before we do that, in this chapter lets discuss how to analyze a debt \\nmutual fund. \\n  \\n \\n25.2 – Risk recap \\nLike in the previous chapter, in this chapter we will pick a debt mutual fund \\nand analyze the fund. But before we do that, I’d like to quickly touch upon the \\nmajor risks associated with a debt fund. \\nCredit risk –  Remember the debt MF invests its money in debt obligations. \\nFor example, company A wants to borrow 50Cr to fund its operations, decides \\nto float a 5-year bond by paying an interest of 9%. AMC X decides to invest in \\nthis bond. Assuming things go smoothly, the company gets the funds, and the \\nAMC gets the interest payment. At the end of 5 years, the company is \\nexpected to repay the principal. \\nAs you can imagine, this is fairly standard practice. \\nThe problem arises if something goes wrong with the company during these \\nfive years and the company is unable to service the interest payment on time. \\nIf things get worse, the company can even throw their hand up in the air and \\nsay, ‘sorry’, no cash to repay the principal or the interest. \\nAll AMCs running debt funds carry this risk, i.e. the risk of default; this is called the ‘credit risk’. Many funds in the past have taken a hit due to such defaults. \\nNow, there is a variation to credit risk. Imagine that as on today, everything is \\ngoing good for company A, but there is trouble brewing within the company \\nand the credit rating agencies identify the same. The rating agencies \\ndowngrade the company’s creditworthiness and lower the credit rating from \\nsay AAA to AA. The act of lowering the credit rating itself is a risk; this is called, \\n‘credit rating risk’. \\n  \\n \\nInterest rate risk –  Bonds prices are sensitive to interest rate changes, both \\nbond prices and interest rates are inversely related. We have discussed this \\nearlier. A fall in interest rate tends to increase the bond prices (which means \\nthe NAV tends to increase) and increase in interest rate tends to decrease the \\nbond prices, and therefore the mutual fund’s NAV. \\nThe sensitivity of the bond prices to the interest rate risk is captured by \\n‘modified duration’ of the bond. Higher the modified duration, higher is the \\nrisk associated with the changes in interest rate. When a debt mutual fund \\nreports the modified duration, then it is the aggregate modified duration \\nacross the various bonds they hold. \\nAlright, now that we had a quick refresher on the risks involved, let us focus \\nour eﬀorts towards analyzing a debt mutual fund. \\n25.3 – Portfolio check  I’ve mentioned this earlier in this chapter; I’d like to say it again, invest in a \\nfund not because it is good or spectacular, invest in it because it aligns with \\nyour portfolio goals. \\nDebt funds allure many investors because of the popular perception that it is \\nlow risk. O\\x00en debt funds get sold as a safe haven for your capital, an \\nalternative to the bank’s fixed deposit. But it is not. \\nI’m not saying this to discourage you from investing in a debt fund; I’m \\nreiterating this to highlight the fact that debt funds are not risk-free. Debt \\nfunds can be volatile and can cause a permanent loss of capital. \\n  \\n \\nAlright, let us move ahead with the analysis part. I’ve picked Mirae Asset \\nShort Term fund for our analysis. The idea is to lay down a template using \\nwhich you can analyze any debt fund of your choice. Much of the analysis in a \\ndebt fund is centred around the risk and the fund’s portfolio, so this will be \\nvery diﬀerent compared to the equity fund analysis. \\nThe fund itself is relatively new, with its NFO sometime in early 2018, so it \\ndoes not have many data points to track, but it is ok. \\nAs the name of fund indicates, this is a short-term fund, meaning the fund will \\ninvest in bonds which have short term maturities ranging between 1 to 3 \\nyears. \\nHave a look at the average maturity graph of the fund, sourced from the AMC \\nwebsite –  \\nThe average maturity of the fund is roughly around 2.5 years, which means \\nthat the fund is susceptible to default risk, credit rating risk, interest rate risk, \\nand the ‘change in the perception’ of interest rate, risk. \\n  \\n \\nNow, in case any of these risks get triggered, then the fall in NAV will be steep, \\nand the fund will take time to recover from the losses. The only way to deal \\nwith this is to ensure you stay invested in the fund for a long enough period. \\nHow long? \\nThere are diﬀerent theories, but I believe that the minimum time you need to \\ninvest in a debt mutual fund should be equal to, at least the average maturity \\nof the fund. So in this case, if I’m investing in this fund, I’d give it roughly 2.5 \\nto 3 years and not below that. \\nSimilarly, if I’m looking at a Gilt fund whose average maturity is ten years, \\nthen I’d be prepared for a long-haul investment lasting at least ten years. \\nThe investment tenure is something you need to be super clear when \\ninvesting in a debt fund. \\nWhile we did not pay much attention to the portfolio in an equity portfolio, \\nwe do have to pay attention to the quality of bonds in a debt portfolio. \\nHere is a quick look at the portfolio allocation (AMC website) – \\n  \\n  \\nThe fund has 67.31% allocation to corporate bonds, which means to the fund \\nis highly susceptible to credit risk. Now, how do we figure out that the debt \\nfund manager is managing the credit risk? Well, we need to check for – \\n○ The diversification of the fund \\n○ Exposure to companies – high exposure to a single corporate \\nentity draws a red flag \\n○ Credit rating check on the papers held by the fund. \\nI dug into the portfolio of this fund; you can do the same by visiting Mirae’s \\ndownload section – \\nhttps://www.miraeassetmf.co.in/mutual-fund-scheme/fixed-income/mirae-a \\nsset-short-term-fund \\nHere is the snapshot of a section of the fund’s portfolio – \\n  \\n  \\nThe fund holds about 56 papers. Straightaway, I can see that the top 3 \\nholdings (3% or more) are all sovereign papers, so there is no concern about \\ncredit risk on single large exposure. \\nWe need to check the exposure at an aggregate level. For example, in the \\nsnapshot above, I can see that the fund has invested 2.44% of its assets in a \\n7% RIL bond maturing in August 2022. \\nThe fund has also invested 1.64% of the assets in 8.3% RIL paper maturing in \\nMarch 2022. So the question is what the total exposure to Reliance Industries \\nLimited is? \\nTo answer the above, you can quickly add up the numbers from the excel or \\ncheck the quick info provided on the AMC’s website – \\n  \\n  \\nThe fund has a total exposure of 5.56% to Reliance, 5.23% to NHB, and 5.12% \\nto PFC. In my opinion, these are slightly concentrated bets. \\nWhile 56 papers seem good enough, let us see how the fund holds up \\ncompared to the category –  \\nThe portfolio aggregates are from Value research online. While the fund has \\n56 securities, the category average is about 64. The fund has a slightly tighter \\nportfolio compared to its peers, while the diﬀerence is not much in this \\nparticular case, one should be concerned if the diﬀerence is large. For example, I’d have been a bit concerned if the fund held 45 securities against \\nan industry average of 65. \\n  \\n \\nMoving ahead with our research, we now look at the quality of the papers. We \\ncan develop a perspective of the quality of papers (bonds) held in the \\nportfolio by looking at the rating profile. \\nFrom AMC’s website –  \\n14.41% are sovereign papers, these papers don’t have credit risk, so that’s \\none less thing to worry. 66.3%, which is the bulk of the portfolio is AAA. But \\ndo remember the ratings tend to change as papers are constantly evaluated \\nfor credit quality by rating agencies. \\nA1+ and AA is roughly 8.5%; this is understandable as the debt fund \\nmanager’s chase yields to showcase performance. The question, however, is \\nto figure if the fund manager is going out of the way to chase yield. \\n  \\n  \\nI’ve got this from Value research online. The fund has a higher exposure to \\nAAA bonds (66%) compared to the category (~45%), which is ok, but this \\ncomes with credit risk. The exposure to Sovereign bonds is less (14.5%) \\ncompared to the category average of about 25%. Exposure to AA bonds is less \\ncompared to the category, and the cash equivalent is higher compared to the \\ncategory. \\nThe information above tells me that the fund is open to taking on slightly \\nhigher credit risk, which to me is not a great sign considering this is a short \\nduration fund. Think about it; this is a short duration fund, people invest in \\nthe fund for parking funds for say 2-3 year perspective with a moderate return \\nexpectation. \\nSo what is the need to take on credit risk? I’d still be ok with the credit risk as \\nlong as there is enough diversification, but the concentrated portfolio is not \\nvery comforting to me. \\n25.4 – Other checks    \\n \\nLet us go back to the portfolio aggregates –  \\nThe modified duration of the fund is 1.97, while the category is 2.34. \\nRemember, the modified duration is sensitivity to changes in interest rate. \\nThe slightly lower modified duration is attributable to the lower average \\nmaturity of the fund. \\nThe average maturity of the fund is 2.28, while the category’s average is 2.89. \\nFrom this, we can deduce that the fund manager is ok with slightly higher \\ncredit risk by placing concentrated bets while at the same time not so ok with \\ninterest rate risk. \\nThe yield to maturity (YTM) of the fund is 4.59 compared to the category’s \\n5.18. Remember, YTM is the total returns expected based on the assumption \\nthat the bond is held to maturity and the cash flow from coupons are \\nploughed back into the bond. \\nIntuition says that the higher the YTM, the better it is, this is correct. But YTM \\ncan also double up as an indicator of risk when compared to the category’s YTM. \\n  \\n \\nFor example, if the category’s YTM is 6% and the fund is 8%, then it implies \\nthat the fund is taking on additional risk to chase yield. \\nIdeally, I’d like to see the fund’s YTM match the category’s YTM, and I’m even \\nok with slightly lower YTM compared to the category. \\nI want to look at the fund’s market risk parameters such as the standard \\ndeviation, beta, and alpha to get a sense of how volatile the fund compared \\nto its benchmark. Ideally, it would help if you looked at it from a 3-year \\nprospective, but since this fund is new, we won’t get that information. \\nLastly, I did look at the AUM of the fund; this is roughly 650Cr. Not a big fund \\ngiven its category. When it comes to Debt funds, I’d like to avoid investing in \\nvery small funds or very large funds. In a situation where there is a run on the \\nAMC and the AMC faces redemption pressure, then a large debt fund will have \\nissues with debt market liquidity. \\nOn the other hand, a small fund will never negotiate good rates with the \\nissuers and hence is always a price taker. So it's always good to avoid both \\nfunds with either small or very large AUMs. \\nSo would I invest in this fund? I’d probably hesitate to do so for a couple of \\nreasons – \\n○ The fund has a concentrated portfolio \\n○ Credit risk is higher compared to the category \\n○ It’s a new fund, and I’m sure there are better alternatives in the \\nmarket \\n○ The fund has a low AUM, understandable since it’s a new fund \\n  \\n \\nIf you are thinking why I’ve not looked at standard stuﬀ like fund ranking, \\nrolling returns, capture ratios, and other things, well, that’s because it does \\nnot matter much for a debt fund. \\nBefore we wrap up this chapters, here are few things for you to note – \\n○ Investment in debt funds is mainly for capital preservation. Do \\nnot look at returns or chase returns when investing in a debt fund \\n○ Please do not look at ‘star ratings’, of a debt fund. Usually, a debt \\nfund is rated high if the returns are high. If a debt fund has a high \\nreturn, that means the fund manager is taking on risk to chase \\nreturns. \\n○ Apart from the standard debt fund risks, keep an eye on the \\nliquidity risk. We have discussed the liquidity risk here – \\nhttps:///chapter/the-debt-funds-part-4/ . If \\nboth the fund’s AUM and the number of securities fall, then it’s a \\nred flag and an indicator of liquidity risk \\n○ SEBI has now mandated the funds to disclose portfolio details on \\na fortnightly basis, this is a good move. Do keep an eye on the \\nportfolio changes \\n○ Always diversify across AMCs, for example, if you want to invest \\nin a short term fund, then split your money across two short term \\nfunds from two diﬀerent AMCs \\n○ It is best if you avoid investing in a credit risk fund. Credit risk \\nfunds take on credit risk to generate a return. In my opinion, you \\nshould not look at debt funds for returns. Use debt funds to \\nsafeguard capital \\n  \\n \\n○ Debt funds sometimes lend to two diﬀerent companies but with \\nthe same promoter. Be wary of such funds. \\nPlease pick up debt funds and try to analyze them in the way we have done in \\nthis chapter. I’d suggest you pick up a fund with at least 5-8 years history. \\nOver the next few chapters, I’ll discuss financial goals and building a mutual \\nfund portfolio to address the financial goal. \\nKey takeaways from this chapter \\n○ The investment in a mutual fund should align with the \\nfinancial goal \\n○ Debt mutual funds carry credit risk, interest risk, and \\nchange in credit rating risk \\n○ The minimum time duration to invest in a debt fund \\nshould be at least equal to the average maturity of the \\nfund \\n○ It is important to analyze the debt fund’s portfolio \\n○ Higher the exposure to corporate bonds, higher is the \\ncredit risk \\n  \\n \\n○ Sovereign bonds do not carry credit risk but do carry \\ninterest rate risk \\n○ One should be concerned about large exposure to a \\nsingle corporate entity \\n○ One can look at YTM as the measure of risk \\n○ It is best to debt funds with large and small AUMs         \\n  \\n \\nCHAPTER  26 \\nThe  Mutual  Fund Portfolio  \\n26.1 – Assumptions \\nWe have reached a stage where we have discussed almost everything related \\nto Mutual funds, leaving us with the last crucial bit, i.e. the mutual fund \\nportfolio construction. I’ve spent last several days to think through the best \\npossible way to explain this, and finally concluded that this is a herculean \\ntask 😊 I’ll explain why in a bit, but don’t worry, I will attempt to explain it 😊 Before we proceed, I need to address a few assumptions I’ve made. \\nWhen we talk about constructing a mutual fund portfolio or for that matter an \\nequity portfolio to solve for a financial goal, we make two assumption – \\n○ We are covered for the risk \\n○ We are covered for emergency \\nBefore a person can have a portfolio of any sort, these two things should be \\nin place. \\nLet me explain what I mean. \\n  \\n\\n \\nCover for the risk –  An individual faces many diﬀerent kinds of risk in his/her \\nlifetime. Risk across multiples areas of life – physical health, mental health, \\npermanent disabilities, a prolonged state of joblessness, broken \\nrelationships, and whatnot.  \\nWhile it is impossible to anticipate everything and get a cover, an individual \\nshould get a cover for two things in life – loss of life and hospitalization. \\nOf course, the cover comes in the form of insurance. Term insurance will \\nensure that your near and dear ones, your dependents are not financially \\nburdened a\\x00er your passing away. \\nHealth insurance will ensure you don’t spend your life’s earnings to pay for \\nhospital bills while getting treated for chronic illness. \\nGiven this, you need to estimate the extent your family will be paid oﬀ if \\nunfortunately, you pass away. Similarly, you need to figure out the extent of \\nhealth insurance cover you need to get. Topics related to insurance are vast \\n  \\n \\nand have many technicalities. I won’t get into this at this point. But I want you \\nto be aware that as an individual, the very first step in your ‘personal finance’ \\njourney is to ensure you get cover for these two types of risks. \\nI want to stress that don’t buy insurance products linked to investment plans. \\nThese are not worth it. \\nCover for an emergency  – I’m referring to an emergency corpus here, an \\nemergency corpus to help you navigate your tough times. Tough time could be a job loss, or it could be as simple as having enough money to replace a \\npiece of electronic equipment at home or a medical emergency. \\nI understand medical emergencies are covered by health insurance but don’t \\ntake that for granted.  To give you an example, in September 2020, both my \\nparents were hit by Covid 19. When I took them to the hospital, the hospital \\nmade me pay a certain amount of money for admission and cover the initial \\nexpenses. Of course, I had an insurance cover for both of them, which later \\ncame in handy, but at that moment, I needed ready cash and needed a fairly \\nlarge amount. \\nOr take this, for example – thanks to Covid 19, schools went online, and I \\nsuddenly had to equip the house with a printer and a laptop for my \\n10-year-old daughter. That was an unplanned financial expense but had to be \\ndone. \\nEmergencies can come in any form and can come at any time. One has to \\nhave suﬀicient funds, which is easily available to you when the emergency \\nstrikes. Given this, at the very initial stages of your ‘personal finance’ journey, \\nI’d advise you to build this emergency corpus. \\n  \\n \\nThe question is, how much money is good enough for the emergency corpus? \\nDiﬀerent people have diﬀerent opinions, but I see most of them agree to have \\nan emergency corpus equivalent to 6 months of expense. For example, if your \\nmonthly expense is 40K, then the emergency corpus should be at least 2.4L. \\nBut I don’t subscribe to the 6-month emergency corpus template. \\nEach person is diﬀerent; each family is diﬀerent. It would help if you sat with \\nyour family, went through diﬀerent scenarios and identified a corpus amount \\ngood enough to sail your family through these tough times. \\nAnyway, I will make these two assumptions – that you have the basic \\ninsurance cover and have built an emergency corpus. With these things taken \\ncare of, we will now understand how to build a mutual fund portfolio. \\n26.2 – Financial Goal \\nImagine a newly married couple. Both the husband and wife are young, say in \\nthe late ’20s, and both are working professionals.  The couple aspires to buy a \\nhouse of their own. Their idea of the home is a 2BHK apartment downtown, \\ncosting roughly 1.5Cr, and they give themselves a ten-year window to achieve \\nthis goal. \\nOr think of this situation – A 40-year-old working woman wants to accumulate \\nmoney to upgrade her car over the next five years. The estimated cost of the \\ncar is 55L. \\nOr imagine this situation (last one, I promise) – A 21-year-old has just started \\nworking for an MNC. Wants to accumulate 20L in 8 years to fund his/her \\npost-graduate degree in the UK. \\n  \\n \\nThese are all examples of a ‘financial goal’. A financial goal has three specific \\nattributes – \\n○ The quantum of funds required \\n○ The estimated time over which these funds need to be \\naccumulated \\n○ The current age of the person \\nWithout these three attributes, a financial goal is incomplete. \\nFor instance, a young working professional who intends to accumulate \\n‘enough money’ to go to the UK for postgraduate studies in a couple of years \\ndown the line, is not a reasonable financial goal. \\nWith the three random scenarios that I have quoted, you can imagine how \\ndiverse each person’s financial aspirations are. No two families or humans \\nwill have the same requirement (apart from retirement maybe). Financial \\ngoals are extremely diverse and very personal to your situation. \\nHowever diverse the situation is, the good thing is that you eventually have to \\nlook at mutual funds to help you solve the situation, well, at least in most \\ncases. \\nOf course, there are other financial instruments, but nothing as versatile as \\nmutual funds (or ETFs). \\nGiven this, there are two ways in which I can help you understand how to \\nbuild a mutual fund portfolio to solve for your financial goals – \\n  \\n \\n○ Consider all sorts of life scenarios, build case studies around it, \\nand stitch together a mutual fund portfolio to solve the given \\nscenarios. You can then look at these scenarios, identify the one \\nclosest to your situation, and build a similar portfolio for \\nyourself.         or \\n○ Help you understand the diﬀerent attributes of funds from a \\nportfolio perspective so that you can identify what sort of funds to pick given the situation. \\nThe diﬀerence between the two approaches is like this – assume you like \\nsavoury dishes, so I give you 20 diﬀerent dishes to try. You taste each one of \\nthese and dishes and finally figure which one to eat fully. \\nAlternatively, I familiarize you with ten basic savoury ingredients. Once \\nfamiliar, you can use these ingredients in the right measure to quickly prepare \\na savoury dish to satisfy your taste buds. \\nI will take the second approach to build a mutual fund portfolio, and I hope \\nthis works out better.   \\n  \\n \\n26.3 – Mutual Fund cheat sheet \\nI’ve prepared this Mutual fund cheat sheet for you. The sheet summarizes all \\nthe key attributes of the diﬀerent mutual funds we have discussed. Please \\nclick on the image to enlarge and get a better view.  \\nThe table is simple, has few basic information – \\n○ Fund type \\n○ Category \\n○ The main constituents of the fund \\n○ Expected CAGR – as much as I hate it, I’ve included this 😊 ○ The minimum holding period – the minimum holding period for \\nthe fund if you were to invest in it. Not that you cannot invest in \\nthe fund and hold it for less than the minimum holding period, it \\nis just that if you do so, recovering from a drawdown could be \\ndiﬀicult. \\n○ Financial Goal – The kind of financial goal the fund can be used \\nfor, more on this later. \\n○ ‘Special remark’ – Things you need to be aware of. \\n  \\n \\nI’d suggest you keep this table handy. This table will help you cra\\x00 a mutual \\nfund portfolio for most of the financial goals. \\nBefore we proceed further, we need to understand an important aspect of the \\nnumber of funds one should have in a portfolio. \\nI’ve seen investors with 10-12 mutual funds in their portfolio for a single \\nfinancial goal. Usually, their portfolio will contain 3-4 large-cap funds, \\nanother 3-4 mid-cap funds, few random debt funds, and perhaps a hybrid \\nfund tucked in. \\nThis is a classic example of a messy, directionless, and a pointless portfolio. \\nIdeally, you need to have non-overlapping mutual funds to avoid redundancy. \\nLet me explain, assume you have the following three large-cap funds in your \\nportfolio – \\n○ Axis Bluechip fund \\n○ Mirae Asset Large cap fund \\n○ Canara Rob Blue chip Equity. \\nAll three funds are good, but does that mean all the three funds should \\nbelong in your portfolio.  Take a look at the top 10 holdings across all the \\nthree funds – \\n  \\n  \\nAs you can see, nearly half the portfolio across all these funds are similar. All \\nfunds hold HDFC Bank to the extent of 10%. If you extend this across all the \\nportfolio holdings, I’m sure the common overlap would be a much bigger \\nnumber. Given this, the performance across these funds also tend to be \\nsimilar. The economic/market factors that impact these funds will be similar, \\nand the volatility will be similar. \\nHence, as an in investor, if you buy multiple funds of the same type across \\ndiﬀerent AMCs, then you need to realize that there is no significant advantage \\nin you doing so. \\nOf course, the only argument for having two funds of the same type is  AMC \\ndiversification, where you split your money across two diﬀerent AMCs. You \\ncan probably do this if you worry that one of the AMCs may fold during the \\ntenure of your investment. \\n  \\n \\nThe better way to do this is to see if you can include funds from diﬀerent AMC, \\nsuch as a large-cap fund from HDFC and a mid-cap fund from DSP, where you \\ndiversify across AMCs and market capitalizations. \\nAs an investor, build your portfolio so that the overlap between funds is \\nminimum. Eliminating overlap is very tough; the idea is to ensure its \\nminimum. Otherwise, you just end up paying just to get the same exposure \\nand costs can eat into your returns significantly. \\n26.4 – Portfolio, by the method of elimination \\nLet us revisit the scenarios we looked at earlier and see how the table can \\ncra\\x00 a mutual fund portfolio. \\nCase 1  – A newly married couple, aspires to buy an apartment, estimated at \\n1.5Cr in 10 years. Both of them work, hence can save 30K each, every month. \\nWe have the following data – \\n1. Savings per month – 30K each \\n2. Target corpus – 1.5Cr \\n3. Time available – 10 Years \\n4. Age – Young can aﬀord to take financial risks in life. \\nGiven this, let us try and arrive at the portfolio by the method of elimination. I \\nfind the elimination technique quite powerful; if not for anything, the \\ntechnique helps us avoid the wrong fund for the given financial goal. \\n  \\n \\nAlright, with ten years’ time frame, we know that investing in debt is not \\nrequired, so let us eliminate the debt category. \\nWhen I say debt is not required, I mean not required as the main investment \\nfund. Let me get back to this in a bit. Debt has another role to play here. \\nThe focus is clearly on Equity as the category. Within Equity as a category, we \\nhave a list of schemes available, which we need to start eliminating – \\n○ Large & Midcap – may not work, since most of these ‘Large & \\nMidcap funds’ are mid-cap stocks anyway. \\n○ Small-cap funds – These are risky, volatile. Of course, ten years is \\na good enough period for this fund, but I’d personally avoid given \\nthe quantum of volatility involved in these funds. \\n○ Multi cap funds – These are again qazi mid, and small-cap stocks, \\nmay as well stick to a straight forward mid-cap fund. \\n○ Focused fund – Concentrated bets. Highly dependent on fund \\nmanager skills. If the fund’s investment turns out to be a mistake, \\nthe realization may come in a bit too late. \\n○ Thematic funds are sector dependent; if the call on sector goes \\nwrong, the fund will take forever to recover. \\n○ ELSS funds – Useless one needs to save on taxes as well. \\n○ Index funds – While this is a great option, somehow, a strict \\n10-year period may not do justice for these funds. These funds \\nare best used for hyper long-term financial goals like retirement. \\n  \\n \\nGiven the rational, we can eliminate all the above funds, which leaves us with \\nthe following options – ○ Large-cap fund \\n○ Mid-cap fund \\n○ Value fund \\nI’d further eliminate the value fund due to the uncertainties involved in \\nunlocking value stocks. Hence, the best option for the couple is to invest in a \\nlarge-cap and mid-cap stock. \\nThey both can choose a fund each across both these categories and start their \\ninvestment journey. Do recall we have discussed how to select an equity \\nmutual fund in the previous chapters. \\nThe easiest way to invest the funds would be a systematic investment plan \\n(SIP) in the selected mutual funds every month. \\nSo how do the numbers stack up assuming a CAGR of 10%? Take a look at the \\ncalculation table below. Note, this is a not the entire table, it is just a part for \\nyou to get the idea – \\n  \\n  \\nI’ve assumed a CAGR of 10% for both large-cap fund and mid-cap fund, of \\ncourse, we can argue endlessly on how conservative/aggressive this return \\npercentage is, but it would be a waste of time for both of us. \\nAs you can see, the couple accumulates 1.21Crs, which is quite close to the \\ntarget funds over the 10-year window. A bank loan can plug in the deficit \\n(which is not much). \\nNow, here is another aspect to consider. What if, as and when you approach \\nthe target year, the market starts to fall and you lose the accumulated wealth? \\nThis is a possibility; a\\x00er all, no one can time the market. \\nOne way to deal with this is to start to shi\\x00 the corpus funds to a debt fund as \\nand when you start approaching the target year. For example, from the 8th \\nyear onwards, they can withdraw the accumulated funds and park it in a debt \\nfund. There are many diﬀerent ways to do this – \\n○ Withdrawal can be made on a monthly/quarterly/semi-annual basis. \\n  \\n \\n○ The funds withdrawn, can go into an ultra short term fund since \\nwe only hold the funds for 3 years. \\nThe idea here is to protect the corpus from a sequence risk, where in the \\nmarket takes a hit as and when the target year approaches. \\nOf course, this is a rather simplified approach, but I’d like to keep it simple \\nand not over complicate it. \\nYou may ask if this a ‘fill it, shut it’ approach with no intervention during the \\ninvestment tenure. Yes, this is largely a fill it and shut it approach. But once in \\na way (like once a year), one should track the fund’s performance and take a \\ncall on continuity. \\nApart from that, you need to keep these two points in mind – \\n○ Use conservative estimates when dealing with returns in \\npersonal finance. If in the end, the returns turn out better, then it \\nis good for you. Consider yourself lucky. \\n○ You need to understand that the equity returns are lumpy and \\nnot smooth and steady like a bank FD returns. You may have no \\nreturns for a long time, but the bulk of the returns will come in a \\nshort burst of times. Unfortunately, no one can time this short \\nburst, hence the need to SIP and give it adequate time. \\nLet us look at another case and see how elimination would help us build a \\nMutual fund portfolio. \\n  \\n \\nCase 2  – A 40-year-old person wants to save 25L over the next eight years for \\nthe kids’ overseas postgraduate degree. Monthly savings available for this \\ngoal is Rs.20,000/- \\nSince the period is less than ten years, there is no point looking at 100% \\nequity investment. The plan would largely involve debt, maybe a small equity \\nportion. \\nOk, to begin with, let us keep Equity aside for now and look at the rest of the \\nfunds. \\nHybrid funds like the Arbitrage fund may be a decent option, but something \\nlike a balanced fund may not be. \\nDebt funds are a good option – \\n○ Liquid funds and overnight funds won’t fit the bill since we are \\ntalking about eight-plus years \\n○ All funds with Macaulay duration of fewer than two years can be \\nignored since these are relatively shorter maturity funds. \\n○ Money market funds too can be ignored since the investor can \\ntake on a slightly higher degree of risk \\n○ A short-duration fund is an option \\n○ Credit risk is risky so that they can be avoided. \\n○ Corporate bonds fund is an option \\n○ GILTS won’t fit the bill either. \\nThis leaves us with three good options – \\n  \\n \\n○ Arbitrage Funds \\n○ Short duration funds \\n○ Corporate bond funds. \\nInvestment in a corporate bond fund requires a greater degree of \\ninvolvement from the investor. If one decides to invest in it, then a regular \\nreview of the scheme’s portfolio is mandatory. If this is not possible, then the \\nonly two options to invest in the short duration fund and the arbitrage fund. \\nProbably the person can split the investment equally in both these funds. \\nOne thing to note, just because the investment is in a short duration fund and \\narbitrage fund, it does not mean that a period review of the fund’s portfolio is \\nnot necessary. Yes, the short duration fund may not need as much scrutiny as \\na corporate bond fund, but it does require you to look at, at least once a \\nquarter. The arbitrage fund too as the portfolio contains a debt portion. \\nI’ll spare you the maths here, but if you assume a 7% CAGR, the target funds \\ncan be accumulated over the given timeframe. \\nSince this is anyway a longish tenure, i.e. 8 years, one can also consider a little \\nequity exposure. Maybe 20-25% of the monthly SIP can go into a large-cap \\nfund. \\nLet us take up one last case – You’ve received a lump sum amount, say Rs.50L \\nfrom the sale of an asset, maybe real estate. You want to use this amount and \\nstart a retirement corpus. However, you are worried about the current state of \\nmarkets and fear that the current market level is unstainable. \\n  \\n \\nRetirement is a hyper long-term financial goal. By hyper long term, I mean 20 \\nplus years but may vary based on your current age. \\nHere is a plan assuming you are not comfortable investing the lump sum right \\naway. \\n○ Invest the lump sum in a fund which oﬀers capital protection (to \\nthe best possible extent) \\n○ Withdraw chunks of it every month and invest that into the \\ndesignated fund for retirement \\n○ Continue doing do so till you deploy the entire capital \\nIn this case, you can decide to invest 50L over 3/6/12 months, based on your \\ncomfort. \\nAssuming, six months, then every month you will invest – \\n5,000,000/6 \\n= 83.3K. \\nThe question is, what is the choice of funds for such a plan of action. \\n○ We need a  carrier fund , which will hold the capital, provide \\nadequate capital protection over the next six months. \\n○ The only funds which fulfil the purpose of the carrier funds are – \\nthe overnight or liquid fund. \\n  \\n \\n○ Identify a target fund for retirement. Recall, retirement is a hyper \\nlong-term financial goal so the funds you pick for this purpose \\nshould fit this bill \\n○ The best funds for retirement (in my opinion) are Index funds, \\nlarge-cap funds, or just a balanced fund. \\nSo the set up here would look like this – \\n○ Park the entire 50L in a liquid fund to redeem the entire amount over six months \\n○ Redeem 83.3K every month from the liquid fund over the next six \\nmonths \\n○ Invest the funds redeemed funds into the retirement fund – say a \\nBalanced Fund and a Midcap fund. Or an Index fund and a \\nmid-cap fund. \\n○ If you are choosing two funds, the funds can be split equally. \\nDo remember, once you invest in these funds, this is largely on autopilot \\nmode with no frequent intervention required from your end. However, you \\nmay need to look at the following – \\n○ Yearly review of performance – ensure your fund is not lagging its \\npeers and behaving more volatile compared to the rest of the \\ncategory \\n  \\n \\n○ You may want to rebalance based on your risk appetite, wherein \\nyou book some profits from the equity funds and deploy the \\nsame in debt funds. \\nApart from the above two, you are fairly set. Please don’t attempt anything \\nelse, and let the market do what it is supposed to do. \\nI’ll stop the case studies here since it is impossible to cover all sorts of cases. \\nBut I hope this chapter has given you a good starting point for designing your \\nmutual fund portfolio. \\nI’d love to dig deeper on this topic of goal-based investing, but at this stage, \\nI’m not sure if I will take that route. If you do want me to do that, share your \\ncomments below. \\nOver the next 2 or 3 chapters, I’d like to discuss the Sovereign gold bonds \\n(SGB), NPS, and perhaps a bit about asset allocation, and wrap up this \\nmodule. \\nKey takeaways from this chapter \\n○ The first step in personal finance is to ensure you have \\nhealth and term insurance \\n○ 2nd most important aspect is to ensure you have an \\nemergency corpus \\n  \\n \\n○ The financial goal is defined by the amount of corpus \\nrequired and the time frame available to accumulate the \\ncorpus \\n○ One of the easier ways to build a mutual fund portfolio is \\nby using the method of elimination \\n○ Always use a conservative approach and tone down your \\nreturn expectations \\n○ Try and avoid having multiple funds of the same \\nsubcategory, have a minimum non-overlapping portfolio \\ninstead \\n○ A common goal for all us to have a retirement corpus \\n○ Once a portfolio is set, a yearly review of the funds is \\nmore than suﬀicient \\n○ Do not over complicate mutual fund portfolio construct     \\n  \\n \\nCHAPTER  27 \\nSmart-beta Funds   27.1 – Overview \\nBefore we get started with this chapter, I need to inform you that this chapter \\n(and the chapter on Index funds) is not authored by me (Karthik). These two \\nchapters are authored by Bhuvan, a brilliant colleague of mine, who is quite \\nknowledgeable on this topic and asset management in general. \\nIn fact, the next chapter on asset allocation will be authored by another \\ngentleman (and a good friend of mine) from the industry who is super \\nknowledgeable about everything related to market finance. \\nI’d like to thank these folks for helping me with this module and sharing their \\nwisdom with all of us. \\nRead on. \\n— \\nIn chapter  6  &  7 , we discussed the basics of a mutual fund and how it works. \\nIn chapter  16 , we specifically talked about index funds. I had mentioned that \\nwe would discuss a relatively new category of funds in the Indian context \\ncalled smart-beta funds and ETFs, but this got delayed. The idea with this \\nchapter is to give you a working knowledge of these funds. \\n  \\n\\n \\nThe term smart-beta evokes a lot of strong opinions among investment \\nprofessionals. Although it sounds fancy, it largely means nothing and is \\nlargely a marketing term. Smart-beta broadly speaking is a catch-all term for \\nfactor investing and any weighting methodology which deviates from \\ntraditional market-cap weighting. If you remember from the previous chapter \\non index funds, an index fund tracks a market-cap-weighted benchmark like a \\nNi\\x00y 50, Ni\\x00y 500 etc. \\nJust as a refresher, a market-cap-weighted index weights stocks based on \\ntheir market cap (outstanding shares X current price). Higher the market cap, \\nhigher the weight in the index. Ni\\x00y 50 is an example. \\nSimilarly, there are ETFs based on fundamentally weighted indices. For \\nexample, an index that weights stocks based on earnings, a combination of \\nfundamental metrics such as earnings, dividends, profitability etc. \\n27. 2 – What is a factor; you might be wondering? \\nA factor is a broad, persistent driver of the returns of a stock. Put another way, \\nin factor investing, you target securities that exhibit a particular characteristic \\nthat drives their returns. Remember this definition, and we’ll come back to \\nthis in a bit. But before we do, it is also important to understand a little bit of \\nhistory for context. \\nFactor investing results from continued academic research starting with the \\nCapital asset pricing model (CAPM), eﬀicient markets hypothesis (EMH) etc. \\nCAPM states that a single factor, the market factor or beta, drives returns, but \\nthis didn’t stick. Factor investing became mainstream when Eugene Fama \\n  \\n \\nand Kenneth French published their landmark research paper The \\nCross-Section of Expected Stock Returns. \\nIn the paper, Fama and French added two more factors – Value and size and \\nmarket factor. This meant that there were other drivers of stock returns than \\njust market risk; this was what came to be known as the Fama French 3-factor \\nmodel. In 2014 this became a 5-factor model when two new factors— \\nprofitability and investment factors were added. \\nApart from the famous Fama French factors, other factors like Momentum \\nand Low Volatility also have been discovered. What do these factors mean? \\nHere’s a  ni\\x00y explanation from Robeco  of the most commonly used factors: \\n  \\nValue The tendency of inexpensive securities, relative to their \\nfundamentals, to outperform over the longer term. \\nMome \\nntum \\nThe tendency of securities that have performed well in the recent \\npast to continue to perform well, and for securities that have \\nperformed poorly to continue to perform poorly. \\nLow risk \\nRefers to the observation that low-risk securities tend to earn \\nhigher risk-adjusted returns than high-risk securities. \\n \\nSo, investors look for stocks that exhibit these traits and then build these \\nfactor portfolios. \\nHow have factors performed in India? There isn’t much data in India, and \\nmost of the factor or smart beta indices are pretty new. But here’s how \\nmomentum, quality, and low volatility have performed vs the Ni\\x00y 50 and \\n500. \\n  \\nQualit \\ny \\nThe tendency of securities issued by sound and profitable \\ncompanies to outperform those issued by less sound and profitable \\ncompanies, and the market as a whole. \\nSize The tendency of bonds issued by companies with little debt \\noutstanding and small-capitalization stocks to outperform the \\nmarket. \\n  \\nThe charts are from  Shyam who runs  Stockviz . \\nImpressive returns all around. Low volatility, in particular, has been \\nimpressive with shallow drawdowns. Ni\\x00y Alpha, a proxy for momentum has \\nbeen impressive but comes with sharp drawdowns. \\nHere are the annual returns for a more granular look.  \\nThe charts are from  Shyam who runs  Stockviz . \\n  \\n \\nBut, it’s also important to understand why these factor premiums exist in the \\nfirst place. There are broadly 3 reasons market practitioners and academics \\npropose: \\nRisk-based : Factor premiums exist because investors need to be \\ncompensated for the additional risk they bear. For example, academic \\nliterature shows that value stocks, i.e. cheap stocks, tend to outperform \\nexpensive stocks over the long run. But cheap stocks more o\\x00en than not \\ntend to be cheaper because they have a higher chance of going bankrupt. Or \\nin the case of an economic downturn, value stocks will be the first ones to go \\nout of business. \\nBehavioural-based:  This camp believes that these factor premiums exist because of behavioural biases among investors. For example, this camp says \\nthat the value premium exists because investors chase glamorous growth \\nstocks and ignore cheap stocks, i.e. your value stocks. Similarly, this camp \\nbelieves that the momentum eﬀect exists because of investor under-reaction \\nand overreaction. They under-react to good news or good earnings and then \\nover-react, causing a feedback loop which pushes prices higher. \\nStructural issues:  This camp says that factor premiums exist because of \\nstructural reasons like illiquidity, high transaction costs, diﬀiculty in applying \\nleverage etc. \\nLike with all things, it’s not just one thing, and it might be a combination of \\nmultiple reasons. Humans are complex beings, and the markets are complex \\nadaptive systems. It would be unwise to conclude anything else. \\n  \\n \\nAt this point, you might have ignored everything I just wrote a\\x00er the charts \\nbecause the returns look so good. But, not so fast. In investing there are no \\nfree lunches except for diversification probably. \\n27.3 – Smart-beta funds in India Smart beta or factor funds are relatively new in India. The first smart beta \\nETFs were just launched about 4-5 years back. There are a few quant funds \\nfrom Reliance, Tata, and DSP. But unlike a smart beta ETF, the methodologies \\nof these funds aren’t fully transparent. \\nHaving said that, these are just index returns, and real-life trading \\nperformance is always diﬀerent due to costs, slippage, changes in market \\nmicrostructure etc. Our markets have evolved a lot since 2005 from when \\nthese indices start. You could argue that they have become a lot eﬀicient. \\nGiven that we are just seeing the launch of the first few smart-beta funds in \\njust the last few years, we don’t have a lot of live trading data yet. But here’s \\nhow quality, value, and low volatility ETFs have performed vs Ni\\x00ybees  \\n  \\n \\nThis data is from 2019, and it’s not a lot to conclude, but it is evident that not \\nall factors perform all the time. \\nFactor or smart beta ETFs have a longer trading record in the US and here’s \\nhow some of the popular smart ETFs have performed vs the S&P 500. Of \\ncourse, this chart is subject to starting point bias because this was the point \\nfrom which continuous trading data was available for all major factor ETFs \\nbut didn’t change the conclusion.  \\nAs you can see, factors are cyclical and can go a long time underperforming \\nsimple broad market index funds. Here’s data in the Indian context, notice \\nhow the top factors keep changing. \\n  \\n                         ICICI Quant Fund presentation \\nValue (IWD) has underperformed the S&P 500, dominated by growth stocks \\nfor over a decade now. Mind you; I’m using these US examples since the data \\nis readily available and the Indian markets aren’t the same as the US.  \\n  \\n \\nNow imagine if you had put 100% of your money in value, not that many \\nwould. Now bear in mind that, no two factors ETFs are the same. Each factor \\ncan be defined and implemented in 100 diﬀerent ways. For example, as \\ndefined in Fama and French’s paper, the value was the price to book, but each \\nvalue ETF or index has a diﬀerent methodology such as price to sales, \\nEBIT/TEV, forward earnings, or a mix of value metrics. This leads to a wide \\ndispersion in returns among the same or similar funds. \\n27.4 – Do smart-beta funds work? \\nThere are broadly speaking two views of thought. On the sceptical side, many \\npeople view factors as backtests and that they are a result of data mining that doesn’t work as advertised. Then, there are a few who believe that they might \\nhave worked in the past but don’t anymore.  \\nOn the other side, you have true believers in factors. Several asset \\nmanagement companies manage 100s of billions on factor strategies. \\nDimensional Fund Advisors (DFA) was most notable among them, which was \\n  \\n \\nfounded by David Booth and managed over $500 billion in assets in various \\nfactor strategies. David Booth was a student of Eugene Fama at the Chicago \\nSchool of Business. Fama also serves on the board of DFA. \\nI personally think that factors do work overtime, but the factor premiums \\naren’t static; they ebb and flow over time. You have to bear a lot of pain for \\nthat premium and have really long-term horizons to harvest that premium. \\nHaving said that investors also must be cognizant that the markets have \\nindeed changed and keep changing over time. In the 90s, when the first \\nfactors were discovered, you could argue that the markets still had many \\nineﬀiciencies and retail investors still made up a good chunk of the markets. \\nToday, everybody has all the data at the click of a button on smartphones, \\nand there are millions of CFA holders, hedge funds that manage trillions of \\ndollars constantly seeking new ineﬀiciencies. Even in India, mutual funds, \\nPMS’, AIFs, HFT traders, institutions have become dominant players in the \\nmarkets. \\nHave the factors been arbitraged away? Unlikely, investors shouldn’t just look \\nat past returns of indices and backtests and have the same expectations. The \\nprobabilities are the premiums might not be as large as they seem. \\nThe proliferation of data and computing power has also led to 100s of new \\nfactors resulting from data mining. If you look at the backtests of some of \\nthese factors, they look amazing, but they are spurious at the end of the day. \\nPractitioners and academics have termed this as the  “factor zoo” .  \\n  \\n \\n27.5 – Should you invest in smart-beta funds? I do not think investing 100% of your equity allocation in smart-beta funds is \\na good idea. Nor do I think that smart-beta funds should be viewed as \\nreplacements for index funds or  good  diversified active funds that  perform \\nconsistently  – emphasis on good and consistent. \\nBut we’ve seen in the previous chapter on index funds that a vast majority of \\nactive funds don’t beat their benchmarks. I do think smart-beta funds are a \\ngood replacement for poorly managed discretionary active funds. The bulk of \\nyour equity allocation should be good consistent diversified active equity \\nfunds or in index funds. And then you can invest in smart-beta funds for that \\nchance of extra returns. \\nBut do remember, factors can go a long time underperforming simple index \\nfunds. These premiums are also sensitive to the amount of money chasing \\nthem. So, as more such funds are launched in India, and more money flows \\ninto them, the factor premiums might not always be as large as they once \\nwere. Remember, there are no free lunches in the markets, and every choice \\nyou make as an investor comes with trade-oﬀs. You need to endure that pain \\nif you hope to harvest those additional returns, say, a simple index fund. \\nOne solution is to diversify among factors, there are multi-factors funds that \\ninvest in multiple factors, but we don’t have many of those in India yet. ICICI \\nalpha low volatility ETF, which was recently launched, combines two \\nmomentum and low volatility. Similarly, DSP Quant Fund and the likes of Tata \\nQuant Fund also are multi-factor funds. But their methodologies aren’t as \\ntransparent as index-based smart beta ETFs. \\n  \\n \\nWe see AMCs slowly launching these funds, and hopefully, we’ll have more \\nchoices in the next couple of years. \\nKey Takeaways from this Chapter \\n● The idea with this chapter was to give you a working \\nunderstanding of smart beta and factor investing. I think you \\nneed to dive deeper if you wish to allocate to these funds. \\nThere are some amazing resources on factor investing, and a \\ncursory Google will surface them. Please dive deeper before \\ninvesting in these funds. \\n● Smart beta is just a marketing term. There is no smart beta or \\ndumb beta. \\n● Smart-beta funds are nothing but factor funds or funds that \\nhave alternatively weighted indices unlike Ni\\x00y 50 which is \\nmarket-cap-weighted \\n● The live performance of factor funds can be diﬀerent than the \\nindices. \\n● Factors can be highly cyclical, and individual factors can \\nunderperform simple diversified funds or index funds for \\ndecades. \\n● If you want to invest in factor funds, diversification among \\nfactors is an important consideration. \\n  \\n  \\nCHAPTER  28   Asset Allocation, An Introduction  \\nDear Readers,  Like this previous chapter, this chapter too is a guest chapter. We are honoured \\nto have this super important chapter authored by  Shyam , who runs  Stockviz . \\nWe are grateful to Shyam for sharing his wisdom on this topic with us. We hope \\nhe can contribute more to Varsity, and enrich Varsity’s content 🙂 Happy reading! \\nKarthik Rangappa.   28.1 – Asset Allocation, an Introduction \\nAn asset is anything that you own. A liability is something that you owe. \\nAn asset can be anything: livestock, gold, stocks, bonds, collectables, art, \\ncopyrights, trademarks, and so and so forth. \\n  \\n\\n  \\nSome assets (bonds, for example) throw-oﬀ cash (pay interest) when you own \\nthem, some (art, for example) don’t. The basic purpose of owning an asset is \\nto transmit wealth through time. \\nTime value of money \\nMoney, in the form of currency, is designed to depreciate over time. Central \\nBanks call this rate of depreciation their “inflation target.” For example, when \\nthe US Fed says that they are targeting 2% inflation, the purchasing power of \\na $100 note will be $98 next year. In India, RBI’s goal is to manage inflation \\nbetween 4% and 6%. We ended the year 2020 with an inflation rate of close to \\n7%. Clearly, stuﬀing money under a mattress is a loser’s game. So, how do \\nyou preserve the purchasing power of your wealth? You buy  assets , of course. \\nDiﬀerent type of assets \\n  \\n  \\nPrecious Metals \\nSince the dawn of civilization, people have been trying to find cost-eﬀective \\nways to store, transport and exchange wealth. It took a while for us to zero-in \\non gold and silver as a medium of exchange and a store of wealth: ● They are rare, ensuring a limited supply. \\n● Takes work to mine, purify, mould, etc. This puts a floor on additional \\nsupply. \\n● Easily understood, measured and assayed. \\n● Suﬀiciently dense so that small quantities representing large notional \\nvalues can be moved around easily. \\nSo, it shouldn’t come to a surprise that most people still think of gold (and \\nprecious metals, in general) as a  must-have  asset. Investors instinctively reach \\n  \\n \\nfor gold when other assets are facing stress. And for savers in countries with a \\nlong history of socialism with their governments trying to confiscate property \\nand inflate away their currencies, gold forms a large part of their savings. \\nReal-estate \\nBroadly, real-estate investing covers land speculation, rental-housing and \\ncommercial property. They each have their unique characteristics and scale \\nrequirements. Each piece of real-estate is diﬀerent – they are not fungible, \\nlike precious metals, nor can they be transported. So every real-estate \\ninvestor’s experience will be diﬀerent. \\nCollectables \\nWell, known pieces of art, baseball cards, stamps, rare-coins etc. are known \\nto hold their value through time. A mature ecosystem of services that curate, \\nauthenticate, promote and store collectables exists to make investing in them \\nrelatively painless. \\nOver the last decade or so, we have seen the rise of  digital  collectables, like \\nbitcoin. They have the added benefit of being infinitely divisible. To use the \\nbitcoin example, even though a single bitcoin is currently worth north of \\n$40,000, a newbie can buy just $10 worth of it. \\nFinancial Assets \\nAssets that can be traded on an exchange, like stocks, bonds, commodities, \\netc. benefit from standardization and the uniform application of laws and \\nregulations. Standardization ensures that investors always get what they paid \\n  \\n \\nfor and regulations ensure that the exchange doesn’t favour one investor over \\nanother while disseminating information, clearing trades, etc. \\nThe most liquid and popular of these assets are stocks/equities, the largest \\nare bonds/fixed-income. Commodities come a close third. Overlaid on top of \\nthese are derivatives – instruments that  derive  their value from an underlying \\nstock/bond/commodity – that are now a bigger market than the assets \\nthemselves. \\nSince the 1980s, the number of diﬀerent asset types traded on electronic \\nexchanges has increased by leaps and bounds. Assets that were once illiquid \\nbecause of physical delivery requirements or geographical barriers have seen \\nan explosion of liquidity as they are now traded through derivatives and ETFs. \\n28.2 – Allocation \\nThe act of splitting one’s savings between the diﬀerent types of assets \\ndescribed above is called “asset allocation.” \\nPrediction is impossible \\nIf you knew which of the assets discussed above would give the best returns, \\nthen you could just put all your money in that single asset. But unfortunately, \\nno one knows the answer to that question. \\nFor example, take US and Indian stocks. For the decade between 2001 and \\n2011, Indian stocks massively out-performed US stocks. \\n  \\n  \\nBut performance completely inverted in the next decade.  \\nWho knows what is going to happen in the next 10 years? \\n  \\n \\nOnce prices start moving, narratives get built around why they are justified \\nand persist forever. The longer the price moves, the stronger the narratives. \\nRemember “India shining,” “secular stagnation,” “home prices always go up?” \\nThe only way to protect yourself from decades of underperformance without \\nhaving to predict is to buy a little bit of all assets. \\n28.3 – Sequence Risk \\nAn average investor rarely sees average returns. \\nMarkets have been around for centuries, but an investment’s lifespan is not \\nmore than a few decades. This leads to all sorts of misconceptions regarding \\naverages and risk capacity. \\nInvestor : On average, over the last 20 years, the NIFTY has given a CAGR of \\n10%. So, if I invest Rs 1 lakh for 5 years, I should get at least Rs 1.61 lakhs, no? \\nMe : No. Consider yourself lucky if you don’t lose money. \\nInvestor : But it has given negative returns only 4 years out of 10. I can survive \\n2 years of negative returns. \\nMe : Let me tell you something about sequence risk. Sequence risk means that \\nit is possible that you could have all of those negative 4 years during the 5 \\nyear period that you have invested.  \\n  \\n \\nMost investors don’t realize that while averages may be true in the aggregate, \\nthey may not survive long enough in the market for their personal experience \\nto match up with the statistics. \\nA simple way to avoid this risk is to invest in a basket of assets whose returns \\nare not correlated to each other. \\n28.4 – Diversification vs Diworsification    A basket with chicken eggs, turkey eggs, goose eggs, quail eggs, pheasant \\neggs and emu eggs is theoretically diversified but practically useless when \\nthe basket is dropped. \\nTo create a diversified portfolio, you need first to understand the drivers \\nbehind each asset class’s returns and how they interact with each other. \\nVectors of diversification \\n  \\n \\nDiﬀerent vectors drive returns of diﬀerent assets and the correlations \\nbetween them. A well-diversified portfolio covers these diﬀerent vectors with \\nminimal overlap. Some examples below. \\nCurrency exchange rates \\nGold is priced in international markets, so its future price movements in India \\nare both a function of global demand and USDINR exchange rate.  \\nMarket composition \\n“old economy” stocks mostly dominate indian equity markets while that of \\nAmerica’s is dominated by tech (“new economy”) stocks. So they require \\nseparate allocations in a portfolio even though they are “stocks.” \\nFlows during panics   \\n \\nAmerican bonds are “safe-haven” assets. During market panics, US bonds get \\nbid up. However, Indian assets are clubbed along with other “emerging \\nmarket” assets and sold-oﬀ. So, while having US bonds in a portfolio can \\ncushion it during sell-oﬀs, owning Indian bonds may not oﬀer the same \\nbenefit. \\nHere’s how the US, Developed Markets and Emerging Market Bond funds have \\nbehaved through time.  \\nBubble assets \\nSome assets, especially digital collectables, are prone to boom-and-bust \\ncycles. While Bitcoin gets all the press…     \\n  \\n… the fact that CryptoKitties raised a total of $23 million in venture capital \\nfunding and people thought paying money to collect and breed virtual cats \\non the blockchain was a good idea should give investors some pause.  \\nA similar dynamic exists in the art market as well, where investors try to spot \\nemerging artists and bid up their works.  \\n  \\n \\n28.4 – Keeping it simple \\nIf you are starting, you will do well to stick with big, liquid asset classes: \\n1. Indian Equities \\n○ Large-cap Index \\n○ Mid-cap fund \\n2. US equities \\nSince large US companies have significant global footprints, the S&P \\n500 index gives ample exposure to most developed worlds. Indian \\ninvestors are unlikely to benefit much from chasing a\\x00er European, \\nFrontier or other Emerging markets. \\n3. Bonds \\n4. Gold \\n5. Real estate \\nIf you are unsure of the relative proportions or you are just getting started, \\nthen an equal weight allocation between them is not such a bad idea. \\nFor US stocks, stick to the cheapest S&P 500 index fund that you can find. \\nFor Bonds, find a short-term bond fund that invests only in government or \\nPSU bonds. For Gold, go for the RBI issued Sovereign Gold Bonds that actually pays you \\n2.5% p.a. for owning gold. \\nFor Real estate, see if exchange-traded REITs make sense. \\n28.5 -Risks to diversification \\n  \\n \\nAs more assets get financialized, building a diversified portfolio becomes \\neasier and more accessible. But financialization also changes the behaviour \\nof the assets themselves. \\nUsing real-estate as an example, transactions in the real-world take months \\nand involve a diﬀerent set of actors than transactions on an exchange-traded \\nREIT that take seconds. The low historical correlations that one might have \\nseen between real-estate and stocks could’ve been a function of the diﬀerent \\nvenues where they were transacted, lower liquidity, long transaction times \\nand inability to cross-leverage. But once you put all these diﬀerent assets on \\nthe same platform and allow investors to lever one asset to buy another, you \\nend up increasing their correlations. So, while financialization makes it easier \\nto diversify, it blunts its eﬀectiveness. \\nKeynotes from this chapter \\n● One cannot avoid buying assets. \\n● Know the diﬀerent types of assets, and the factors drive their \\nreturns. \\n● Draw-up an asset-allocation strategy (KISS: Keep It Simple, \\nStupid!) \\n● Stick to the allocation strategy because prediction is \\nimpossible. \\n● Nothing works all the time. The world around you changes. Be \\npragmatic. \\n  \\n \\nCHAPTER  29 \\nExchange Traded Funds  \\nPlease note, this is a guest chapter, and I’ve not authored this. This chapter on \\nETFs is authored by my colleague, Bhuvan. However, I’ll try and answer all the \\nfollowing queries that you’d post.  Happy learning,  -Karthik Rangappa. 29.1 – Overview  In  chapter 7 , we looked at what a mutual fund is and how it works. To recap, a \\nmutual fund is a pooled investment vehicle that collects the money from \\nvarious investors, invests and manages that money on their behalf. When you \\ninvest in a mutual fund before the order placement cut-oﬀ time, you will get \\nthe units as per the same day’s NAV which is disclosed by midnight. If you \\ninvest a\\x00er the order placement cut-oﬀ time, you’ll get the allotment of units \\nper the next day’s NAV. Basically, everything happens at the end of the day. \\nNow, what if those mutual funds units could be traded on the stock exchange \\njust like stocks like Reliance or Infosys? Just like a mutual fund, an \\nexchange-traded fund (ETF) is a pooled investment vehicle that holds a \\nbasket of securities like stocks, bonds, and commodities and trades on the \\nstock exchanges. You can buy and sell an ETF anytime, just like a stock. \\n  \\n\\n \\nThere are a few more nuances to an ETF than a mutual fund, but before we \\ndive in, I hope you have a working idea of what an ETF is. \\n29.2 – History of ETFs \\nMutual funds have been around in some form for well over 100-years. The \\nfirst open-ended mutual fund in the US was launched in 1924 and is still in \\nexistence today. The first mutual fund in India was launched in 1964. Mutual \\nfunds have democratized access to stocks, bonds, real estate and \\ncommodities globally to common investors. Exchange-traded funds (ETF) \\nwere the next evolution of mutual funds. \\nETFs, on the other hand, are relatively new. The SPDR S&P 500 trust, arguably \\nthe first ETF, was launched in 1993 in the US. Coincidentally, it is today the \\nlargest traded security in the world. Ni\\x00yBeES, an ETF tracking the Ni\\x00y 50 \\nindex was the first ETF in India and was launched in 2000. It was launched by \\nBenchmark AMC, which Goldman Sachs later acquired, which Reliance later \\nacquired, which Nippon India Mutual Fund later acquired 🙂 29.3 – ETFs in India \\nThough ETFs have been around for a while in India, they haven’t really been \\npopular among retail investors. ETFs have mostly been used by HNIs and \\ninstitutions. For example, the SBI Ni\\x00y 50 ETF with Rs 89,441.55 cr is the \\nlargest mutual fund in India. This is almost entirely because this is one of the \\nETFs in which the Employees’ Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO) invests. \\nA large part of the ETF AUM growth is due to: \\n  \\n \\n● EPFO investing in Ni\\x00y & Sensex ETF \\n● Government divestment through CPSE ETF and Bharat 22 ETF \\n● Introduction and the Govt push for Bharat Bond Debt ETFs. Most of the \\nAUM in these ETFs is non-retail.  \\nGrowth of ETF AUM in India \\nThough still a small piece of the pie, retail participation has been growing \\nsteadily over the years and so has the trading turnover on the exchanges. \\nNi\\x00yBeES which is 20 years old, just has about Rs 2800 crores of AUM. There \\nare a lot of reasons for the under penetration of ETFs: \\n1. India is still a tiny market. We just have about 1.7 crore active demat \\naccounts, and unlike a mutual fund, you can only buy an ETF if you \\nhave a demat account. \\n2. Investment products, be it mutual funds or ETFs are push products. \\nOne of the reasons why mutual funds are larger than ETFs is because \\nAMCs can pay distributors & platforms commissions to sell their mutual \\nfunds. But ETFs don’t have commissions like mutual funds. \\n  \\n \\n3. ETFs are also relatively trickier to understand initially compared to \\nmutual funds. But we’ll take care of that with this chapter. \\n4. Most AMCs rarely push ETFs because they have low margins and don’t \\nmake sense with small AUMs.  \\n29.4 – What is an ETF? \\nAn exchange-traded fund (ETF), just like a mutual fund is a basket of \\nsecurities, but this is where the similarity with a mutual fund ends. Unlike a \\nmutual fund, an ETF trades throughout the day on the stock exchanges. You \\ncan buy and sell an ETF anytime you want just like a stock. \\nFor example, if you search for “Ni\\x00y ETF” on Kite, you’ll see a list of all ETFs \\nthat track the Ni\\x00y 50 index. \\n  \\n  \\nSearching ETFs on Kite \\n29.5 – How does an ETF work? \\nWhen you buy a mutual fund, the AMC takes money from you and buys the \\nsecurities and discloses the NAV at the end of the day. Similarly, when you \\nredeem your mutual funds, the AMC sells the securities and returns your \\nmoney. This is quite straightforward. However, when you buy an ETF, you \\ndon’t really interact with the AMC most of the time because most buying and \\nselling happens on the stock exchanges. It’s just an exchange of units \\nbetween buyers and sellers. \\n29.6 – Creation and redemption mechanism \\nI said when you buy an ETF, you “mostly” don’t interact with the AMC and I’ll \\nexplain what that means. If you remember  chapter 6 , we discussed all the \\nentities involved in an MF transaction — the AMC, custodian and the RTA. But \\nwhat makes an ETF unique is something called the creation and redemption mechanism. But before we talk about it, you need to know a couple of things. \\n  \\n \\n1. NAV, iNAV, the market price \\n2. Market makers and authorized participants \\n3. Creation units \\n4. Premiums & discounts \\n5. Tracking error \\nMarket price \\nWhen you buy a mutual fund, you look at the NAV. Similarly, when you are \\nbuying an ETF, you look at the ETF market price on Kite.  \\nETF prices \\nThese prices are determined by the demand, supply and the trading activity \\non the exchanges. But how do you know if the price you see on Kite is the fair \\nprice you are paying for an ETF? Here’s where the Net Asset Value (NAV) \\ncomes in. \\nNet asset value (NAV) \\n  \\n \\nLike a mutual fund, an ETF also has an end of the day Net Asset Value (NAV). \\nJust to refresh your memory, NAV tells you the total value of all the fund’s \\nassets and yours. The formula for calculating NAV is NAV = (Value of all the \\nassets – the expenses)/number of shares (units). But remember, an ETF \\ntrades real-time, whereas NAVs are only announced at the end of the day. So \\nhow do you figure out if the price you are paying for an ETF is fair in real-time? \\nEnter iNAV \\nIntraday or indicative net asset value (iNAV) \\nGiven that ETFs trade real-time, you need a reference point to see if the \\nmarket price you see on your trading platform is a fair one and the indicative \\nor intraday NAV (iNAV) serves as that reference. AMCs usually calculate this \\nevery 10-15 seconds and publish it on their websites. iNAV = last traded price \\nof all the securities in the ETF basket X number of shares in the ETF creation \\nbasket + cash component (i.e. cash which is not deployed in the ETF) divided \\nby total ETF shares in the creation basket. Put simply; this serves as a \\nreal-time NAV so that you can use this as a fair value reference to compare it \\nwith the current market price on the stock exchanges. \\nCreation unit \\nLike buying ETF units on the stock exchange, you can also buy units directly \\nfrom the AMC. I’ll explain why you’d want to do that later. But, unlike the \\nexchanges, you cannot buy 1 or 2 units directly from the AMC. You can only \\ncreate and redeem units in what’s called the creation size that the AMC \\ndefines. A creation unit is nothing but a representative basket of all the \\nsecurities in the same proportion as the underlying index. For example, the \\n  \\n \\ncreation unit size of the ICICI Ni\\x00y 50 ETF is 50,000 units, and as of this \\nwriting, it’s about Rs 80 lakhs. Meaning, you need 80 lakhs to buy all the \\nstocks in Ni\\x00y 50 in the same weight. \\nMarket makers and authorized participants (APs)  Unlike mutual funds, there’s another entity called market markers or \\nauthorized participants in the ETF ecosystem. The role of these guys is to \\nprovide liquidity on the stock exchanges. You don’t have to worry about \\nliquidity in a mutual fund because there’s no real-time trading. But since an \\nETF trades real-time on the exchange, market makers are appointed by the \\nAMC to provide liquidity continuously. They do this by providing continuous \\ntwo-way quotes on the exchange, meaning they buy at the  bid  and sell at the \\noﬀer , and the diﬀerence is the profit they make. Even though these are small \\namounts, since they keep doing this, it tends to add up. \\nMarket makers typically tend to be large brokers in India. \\nPremiums and discounts \\nSince an ETF trades real-time on the exchanges, their price is influenced by \\ndemand and supply—the prices of liquid ETFs trade in line with the NAV of the \\nETF most of the time. But sometimes, particularly during volatile market \\nphases, the price of an ETF can trade away from the NAV of the ETF. If the \\nprice of an ETF is above its NAV, it’s called a premium and if the price is below \\nit’s NAV, it’s called a discount. \\nTracking error \\n  \\n \\nTracking error is the annualized standard deviation of the diﬀerence between \\nthe ETF NAV returns and the index that it tracks. In simple terms, it shows you \\nhow closely an ETF tracks its underlying benchmark. A simple example would \\nbe if Ni\\x00y 50 returned 10% and Ni\\x00y ETF gave 9.8%, the tracking error would \\nbe 0.2%. An ETF or an index fund will have lower returns than the index \\nbecause they have an expense ratio and an index doesn’t. \\nA lower tracking error indicates that an ETF or an index fund is tracking the \\nindex better. But this is not really an intuitive measure to understand and \\nwe’ll discuss that later. \\nWith these concepts in mind, let’s get back to the concept of creation and \\nredemption mechanism \\nThere are a few reasons why the creation and redemption mechanism is \\nimportant. For one, you need not always buy an ETF on the stock exchange. If \\nyou are buying in multiples of the creation unit size, buying it directly from \\nthe AMC is way better because you might face liquidity issues and impact \\ncosts when you buy large quantities on the exchange. \\nSo, in the example I mentioned above, the ICICI Ni\\x00y 50 ETF’s creation size is \\nroughly 80 lakhs. If you are investing in multiples of 80 lakhs, you can directly \\ncontact ICICI, and they will create units, in this case, 50,000 units and credit \\nthem to your demat. The AMC will create units at the iNAV.  Similarly, you can \\nredeem them by transferring the ETF units to ICICI, and they will credit the \\ncash to your bank account or you can also get the underlying shares instead \\nof cash. \\n  \\n \\nThe second reason why creation and redemption mechanisms are important \\nis for ETF arbitrage. Like I mentioned earlier, ETFs can trade at premiums and \\ndiscounts to the NAV. Market makers are essential in the ETF ecosystem \\nbecause they are responsible for correcting these premiums and discounts. They do this through the creation and redemption mechanism. \\nTypically ETFs trade close to their NAVs. Here’s a comparison of Ni\\x00y BeEs, \\nSBI Ni\\x00y ETF, ICICI ETF and Ni\\x00y 50.  \\nNi\\x00y ETFs vs Ni\\x00y 50 \\nBut during a volatile market phase, for example, like the COVID crash in 2020, \\nthere can be wide premiums and discounts. Here’s how even a popular ETF \\nlike Ni\\x00yBeEs and SBI Ni\\x00y 50 ETF, India’s largest mutual fund performed \\nduring the volatile market phase of March-April 2020. \\n  \\n  \\nNifybees vs Ni\\x00y 50 \\nNow, here’s where the market makers come in. If there’s a premium, the \\nauthorized participant (AP) will buy all the underlying securities that make up \\nthe ETF creation unit. In this case, the AP will buy all the 50 Ni\\x00y stocks of the \\nsame weight; this is also called the creation basket and give them to the AMC. \\nIn turn, the AMC will create ETF shares and give them to the AP, who will then \\nsell them on the exchange. \\nSimilarly, if there’s a discount, the AP will buy the ETF units on the exchange \\nand give them to the AMC. In return, the AMC will give the underlying shares \\nof the ETF to the AP, who will, in turn, sell them in the market. The diﬀerence \\nbetween the premium, discount, and the NAV will be the AP/market maker’s \\nprofit. \\nPerhaps, the best example of this would be the Motilal Oswal NASDAQ 100 (N100). During 2017-2018, the ETF was trading at a huge premium to the NAV. \\nThe premiums were as high as 20%+. This was probably because the market \\nmakers weren’t active in providing liquidity. Value Research allows you to \\n  \\n \\ncompare the NAV and price , here’s a chart, notice the huge diﬀerence \\nbetween the NAV and the price. \\nSomeone could have taken advantage of this premium by going to Motilal \\nAMC and asking them to create units, which happens at the NAV and sell them \\nat the market price on the exchange. The diﬀerence would’ve been the profit.  \\nN100 ETF price vs NAV \\nThis premium persisted for a long time. Then Motilal, If I’m not wrong, \\nappointed new market makers and launched a fund of funds (FOF) for the \\nETF, which corrected the premium. So the market maker around 2018 would \\nhave created Motilal units at the NAV and sold them on the exchange at the \\nmarket price and corrected the premium. \\n  \\n  \\nN100 ETF price vs NAV \\nThis is how the creation and redemption mechanism in an ETF is used to \\nensure liquidity and arbitrage premiums and discounts. \\n29.7 – ETF liquidity \\nThis is the most important thing when buying or selling an ETF because they \\ntrade real-time. When choosing an ETF, most people tend to look at the AUM \\nof an ETF and the trading volumes to decide if an ETF is liquid. Although these \\n2 things should be considered, the size of an ETF or the daily trading volumes \\nalone don’t indicate liquidity. \\nLet’s unpack what ETF liquidity really means. It’s essential to remember at \\nthis point that even though ETFs trade like stocks, they are not the same. \\n  \\n  \\nLayers of ETF liquidity -American Century   Secondary market liquidity:  This is what you see on your trading platform. \\nThe spread between the bids and oﬀers give you an idea of the available \\nliquidity, but that’s not all. Take a look at this image, comparing Mirae Ni\\x00y 50 \\nETF and LIC Ni\\x00y 50 ETF. The LIC ETF has an AUM of Rs 618 crs, and the Mirae \\nETF has about 483 crs. As of writing this post, both the ETFs had just traded \\n500+ units. \\n  \\n  \\nSpreads \\nTypically, you’d ignore both ETFs assuming that they are too small and don’t \\ntrade much. But that would be an incorrect assumption because on-screen \\nliquidity isn’t everything. \\nETF market depth:  If you look at the Mirae ETF, nearly 60,000 shares are \\navailable for purchase. That means, even if you place a market order, which is \\na really terrible mistake when buying an ETF, you will get a good fill at Rs \\n157.44. This is probably a market maker posting a bid and an oﬀer. The LIC \\nETF, on the other hand, has no liquidity at all. If you’d have placed a market \\norder for 100 units by chance, your average price would have been way higher \\nthan the last traded price, given that there are no volumes and your order \\nwould’ve been continuously executed at higher and higher prices. \\nSo, AUM and trading volumes don’t tell you everything. Market markers \\ntypically hold units that don’t show up in the market depth. If you place a \\nlimit order to buy, your order will be executed as the market makers place an \\n  \\n \\norder to sell. But yeah, not all ETFs have active market makers, this has to be \\npart of your ETF due diligence which we’ll talk about in a bit. \\nHere’s how the Mirae ETF and LIC ETF have tracked Ni\\x00y 50. While Mirae has \\nclosely tracked Ni\\x00y 50, LIC has been all over the place trading at premiums \\nand discounts.  \\nMirae vs LIC Ni\\x00y 50 ETF \\nPrimary market:  The third layer of ETF liquidity is the primary liquidity. \\nRemember, a stock has a fixed number of shares on oﬀer, But even though an \\nETF trades like a stock, it’s not a stock. Market makers and investors can \\ncreate new ETF units. Large institutions, HNIs, typically don’t buy ETFs on the \\nexchange. They directly reach out to the AMC and create units that don’t \\nshow up on your trading platforms’ market depth. \\nLiquidity of the underlying stocks:  The last and the most important layer of \\nETF liquidity is how liquid the underlying stocks that make up an ETF are. \\nRemember, an ETF is just a wrapper that holds all the stocks that make up the \\nETF or an index. So, an ETF can only be as liquid as the underlying stocks. \\n  \\n \\nThis might be a little confusing, so let’s take an example. Today, in India, we \\ndon’t yet have a small-cap ETF, have you ever wondered why? In the Indian \\nmarkets, the liquidity quickly starts disappearing a\\x00er the 200 largest stocks. \\nAs we go down the market cap, the smaller stocks tend to have less \\noutstanding shares, less trading volumes, and usually keep hitting upper and \\nlower circuits. \\nSo, assuming there was a small-cap ETF and that there was a sudden spike in \\ndemand, the market maker would have had to create units to satisfy the demand. Now if some of the underlying stocks are not liquid or have hit \\ncircuits, which is quite common in small-caps, he wouldn’t have been able to \\ncreate units. In such a case, the ETF will probably trade at a premium to the \\nNAV because there will be more demand for the existing units. Not just, \\nsmall-caps, even mid-cap stocks in India have liquidity issues. So, an ETF can \\nonly be as liquid as it’s underlying stocks. But this isn’t a problem in a \\nlarge-cap ETF like a Ni\\x00y 50 ETF because these are the biggest and the most \\nliquid stocks. \\nTo summarize, trading volumes and AUM are factors, but they don’t tell you \\neverything about an ETF. \\n29.8 – ETF choices in India \\nLike I mentioned at the start of the chapter, ETFs are pretty new in India, we \\nhave about 88 ETFs today. A majority of them are equity ETFs. Here are your \\nETF choices: \\n1. Equity ETFs \\nThere broadly 2 sub-categories of equity ETFs. You have your plain \\n  \\n \\nvanilla  market-cap-weighted ETFs  that track indices like the Ni\\x00y 50, \\nNi\\x00y 100, Sensex etc. And then you have  smart beta ETFs  which target \\nfactors such as value, quality, low-volatility, momentum etc. \\n2. Debt ETFs \\nWe have debt G-sec ETFs, Bharat bond ETF which just holds bonds \\nissued by PSUs, and then you have an ETF like the CPSE+SDL ETF by \\nNippon which holds PSU bonds and State development loans (SDLs). \\n3. Commodity ETFs \\nFor now, we just have gold ETFs. \\nHere’s a  list of all Indian ETFs . \\nAre all ETFs passive? \\nThis is a common question that keeps coming up. Today, the biggest ETFs we \\nhave are passive ETFs that track either the Ni\\x00y 50 or Sensex 30. But smart \\nbeta ETFs aren’t passive, even though the ETFs track an index. They are more \\nof a hybrid of active & passive like we discussed in the  smart beta chapter . \\nGlobally, 80-90% of all ETFs are passive, but we see the first traditional active \\nETFs in the US. Maybe, we’ll eventually see them in India as well. So ETFs \\nneed not be all passive, it’s just that they are passive today. \\nETF due diligence \\nI know this has been a little long, but the idea was to give you the full context \\nyou need before investing in an ETF and help you avoid rude surprises. And I \\nhope at this point; you have a clear understanding of how an ETF works and \\n  \\n \\nits mechanics. With that in mind, let’s now look at some things you should \\nconsider before you buy an ETF. \\nAlways use limit orders \\nI cannot stress this enough but never use market orders when buying an ETF, \\nalways use limit orders. This is one mistake I see investors constantly make. \\nWe saw this earlier but let me reiterate this with an example. Take a look at \\nthe market depth of Aditya Birla Sun Life Ni\\x00y Next 50 ETF. If you placed a \\nmarket order for 200 units, your order would be executed at prices starting \\nfrom Rs 350, which is above the LTP, to begin with, and finally, at Rs 374, that’s \\n8.7% higher than the LTP.  So, always use limit orders.  \\nMarket depth of Aditya Birla Ni\\x00y Next 50 ETF \\n  \\n \\nAlways check the iNAV \\nAlways look at the iNAV on the AMC website and place a limit order at that \\nlevel. Don’t just place a limit order without looking at the iNAV. The other \\nissue is that sometimes AMC websites don’t update their iNAVs or their \\nwebsites might be down. If there is a big diﬀerence between the last updated \\niNAV and the current market price, that’s a sign that there is something \\nwrong. So, make sure to compare the ETF with the intraday chart of the \\nunderlying index of the ETF on Kite, and that will give you an indication if the \\nprice is correct. Check with the AMC in such a case before placing an order. \\nCompare the NAV and the price of an ETF and see how it has performed \\nYou should always buy an ETF that tracks the underlying index as closely as \\npossible. Here’s how Nippon Ni\\x00yBeEs ETF has tracked it’s NAV, it’s pretty \\nclose. You can compare the price and the NAV on  Value Research ; we’ll try \\nhaving this feature on Coin.  \\nNi\\x00ybees NAV vs price \\n  \\n \\nPicking up on the earlier point about the tracking error, AMCs disclose the \\ntracking error on their factsheets. But if you see a tracking error as 0.02%, it’s \\nhard to understand what it means. Moreover, AMCs calculate the tracking \\nerror on the NAV, but you buy and sell based on the price, which can be totally \\ndiﬀerent. So the best way to analyse an ETF is to look at the diﬀerence \\nbetween ETF prices and the underlying index. You want the price of ETF to \\ntrack the index consistently without huge diﬀerences. \\nNote:  Always compare the ETF price with the  total returns index (TRI)  and \\nnot the price returns the index (PRI). The TRI includes dividends. All the \\nindex data you see on Kite is PRI. Since ETFs track TRI indices, they \\nreinvest the dividends which reflects in the NAV of the ETF.  Look at the average volumes \\nLook at the average volumes over a period of time and see how an ETF has \\ntraded. You should invest in an ETF that trades regularly. You should avoid \\nETFs that just have a brief spike in volumes and then don’t trade. The \\nEdelweiss ETF – Ni\\x00y 100 Quality 30 is an example. The monthly average \\nvolumes are about 150 units. You can check the average volumes by applying \\na moving average on the volume chart on Kite. So assuming you had bought \\nthis ETF and had to exit, you most likely wouldn’t have been able to. \\n  \\n  \\nEdelweiss ETF – Ni\\x00y 100 Quality 30 \\nAvoid buying and selling at market open \\nMost ETFs don’t trade much for 30 mins to 1 hour of the market open. They \\nalso tend to trade at abnormal prices because of the low volumes, even \\norders for a few units can move prices. If you can, avoid trading in the open. \\nAnd if you have to, check and verify the iNAV and use limit orders. Is the AMC focussed on ETFs? \\nToday, most of the AMCs oﬀer ETFs but that doesn't mean they are serious \\nabout them. Most of the ETF volumes are in ETFs oﬀered by Nippon, ICICI, \\nand SBI largely. Other AMCs like Mirae, Edelweiss with their debt ETFs do \\nseem serious about building out their ETF oﬀerings. So, along with the other \\nthings on the due diligence list, you’ll also have to look at whether an AMC is \\nserious about the ETFs it oﬀers. For example, if you look at some of the ETFs \\nby Aditya Birla Mutual Fund, IDBI, LIC, Indiabulls etc., they have horrible \\ntracking errors and almost no volumes. \\n  \\n \\nCreating units with the AMC for higher-value investments \\nIf your investments in ETFs are equal to or more than the creation basket \\nvalue, it’s better if you approach the AMC to create units rather then buying \\non the stock exchange. \\n29.9 – ETF vs index funds \\nThis is another question that keeps coming up. Hopefully, this table should \\nhelp answer these questions. In short, if you want to have active control or if \\nyou are actively using passive ETFs, then ETFs are a better choice. But if you \\nare lazy like me and want to make as few choices as possible, then index \\nfunds are a better choice. \\nWith ETFs, you can express tactical strategies better than index funds because \\nyou can’t buy and sell index funds immediately. \\n  \\nIndex funds  Exchange-traded funds \\nEnd of the day NAV  Real-time pricing. Can be bought \\nand sold anytime \\n \\n  \\nNo issue of spreads because \\nexecution happens at the end of the \\nday \\nYou might see wide spreads in \\ncertain ETFs and during market \\nvolatility. \\nLiquidity isn’t an issue and can be \\nmanaged. \\nCertain ETFs don’t trade much, and \\nunderlying liquidity of stocks can \\nimpact APs and market-making \\nCan create SIPs  Possible with Zerodha, may not be \\npossible with other brokers \\nExpense ratio is all-inclusive—no \\nadditional charges \\nYou have to pay a brokerage (free at \\nZerodha) & other charges & taxes \\nseparately \\nNot possible to have tactical \\nstrategies. Less flexible compared to \\nETFs \\nWith ETFs since you can buy & sell \\nanytime, you can express tactical \\nviews. ETFs are much more flexible \\n \\n29.10 – Performance of ETFs vs actively managed funds \\nWe discussed this earlier in the  index funds chapter  as well. In the last decade \\nor so, index funds and ETFs have become increasingly popular around the \\nworld. One reason is that investors have increasingly realized that a vast \\nmajority of actively managed mutual funds don’t beat their benchmarks. In a \\ndeveloped market like the US,   ~90%  of active funds don’t beat their \\nbenchmarks. \\nThe Indian markets have grown a fair bit and have become increasingly \\nprofessionalized; institutional investors are a big part of today’s market. This \\nmeans that most of the informational edges and asymmetries have been \\narbitraged away. Today, pretty much everyone has access to the same \\ninformation. The odds of someone finding some piece of information that can \\nmove a stock, at least in the large-cap space, for example, is pretty much zero. \\n  \\nIndex funds tend to hold more cash \\nand hence have a slightly higher \\ntracking error \\nETFs don’t hold much cash and \\nhence have a lower tracking error \\nLesser choice at-least as of now. But \\nAMCs are launching a fund of funds \\nfor ETFs \\nPretty much all of the smart-beta \\nproducts are ETFs. You have a wider choice \\n \\nBut perhaps the biggest reason why active funds underperform is that they \\ncharge too much. \\nActively managed large-cap funds on an average charge~1.5% whereas a Ni\\x00y \\n50 index fund is available for 0.10%. And we see this in the performance. S&P \\npublishes a  report called SPIVA , which measures the performance of active \\nfunds. For any period, over 70% of all large-cap funds fail to beat their \\nbenchmarks.  \\nSPIVA India \\nTraditionally, the view was that the mid-cap and small-cap space was \\nineﬀicient, and this was where stock pickers thrived. While this was true, it \\nseems like this is increasingly becoming less so. In the last 5 years since the \\nSEBI categorization exercise, active mid-cap funds have had a tough time \\nkeeping up with a broad mid-cap benchmark like the Ni\\x00y 50 or BSE/NSE Mid-cap 150 index and even Ni\\x00y Next 50 etc. Here’s a quick look, this is just \\nfor illustration, and ideally, you should look at the  rolling returns . \\n    3 Yr Ret (%) 5 Yr Ret (%) 10 Yr Ret \\n(%) \\n \\n  \\nFund Name Kotak Emerging Equity Fund \\nRegular Plan \\n12.09  19.16  17.89 \\nDSP Midcap Fund – Regular Plan  10.97  18.49  16.63 \\nInvesco India Mid Cap Fund  13.24  18.07  17.95 \\nEdelweiss Mid Cap Fund – \\nRegular Plan \\n9.85  17.92  18.28 \\nNippon India Growth Fund  10.68  17.65  13.27 \\nBSE Midcap 150 Index  9.07  17.6  12.94 \\n \\n  \\nTaurus Discovery (Midcap) Fund \\n– Regular Plan \\n9.44  17.59  15.3 \\nTata Midcap Growth Fund – \\nRegular Plan \\n11.2  16.91  16.93 \\nHDFC Mid-Cap Opportunities \\nFund \\n8.03  16.44  17.41 \\nL&T Midcap Fund  5.39  16.33  16.15 \\nFranklin India Prima Fund  8.86  15.79  17.27 \\nICICI Prudential Midcap Fund  6.98  15.28  15.07 \\nUTI Mid Cap Fund – Regular Plan  8.68  15.27  17.2 \\n  \\n  \\nBNP Paribas Midcap Fund  8.44  14.94  17.59 \\nBaroda Midcap Fund  8.52  14.51  3.73 \\nMotilal Oswal Midcap 100 \\nExchange Traded Fund \\n5.8  14.36  12.11 \\nSBI Magnum Midcap Fund  9.36  13.97  17.37 \\nSundaram Mid Cap Fund – \\nRegular Plan \\n3.56  13.25  14.98 \\nQuant Mid Cap Fund  12.15  13.01  11.29 \\nAditya Birla Sun Life Mid Cap \\nFund \\n2.77  12.28  12.94 \\n \\nThe bottom line is that most actively managed funds don’t outperform a \\nsimple broad-market ETFs or index funds like Ni\\x00y 50, Ni\\x00y Next 50 and Ni\\x00y \\nMidcap 150. This is due to a combination of high costs, increasing market \\neﬀiciency, and internal fund mandates to not deviate too much from the \\nindices. Moreover, it’s tough to pick those funds & managers that beat their \\nbenchmarks. And even if you figure out how to pick a winning manager, there \\nis very little persistence in performance. The best performing fund o\\x00en ends \\nup being the worst-performing fund over a period of time. \\nToday, it’s a no-brainer to look at index funds in the large-cap space. There’s \\nincreasing evidence that it’s the same in the mid-cap space as well. As for \\nsmall-caps, these are severely risky and buy and hold may not be an optimal \\nstrategy, and active management both in a fund and in timing is needed. \\nKey takeaways from this chapter \\n● ETFs trade real-time on the stock exchanges and you can now \\nset-up SIPs in ETFs to invest every month \\n● Blindly choosing an ETF is a bad idea.

I \\ncan easily think of another 10 or 15 chapters to add, but I won’t do that 🙂 I think we have covered the major chunk of personal finance, i.e. investments \\n(via mutual funds), and in the process, discussed a ton of other information. I \\nhope you’ve found this module useful. \\nI want to end this module with a chapter on MacroEconomics. \\nMacroeconomics in a personal finance module? Well, I’m sure you may \\nwonder why I’d want to discuss macroeconomics in a personal finance \\nmodule. A\\x00er all, personal finance is related to an individual or a family’s \\nfinances. On the other hand, macroeconomics is a much wider topic related \\nto a country’s economic well-fare. \\nWhat is the connection here? \\nYou like it or not; your financial fortune is highly dependent on how the \\ncountry as a whole does; this is especially true when you save for long and \\nhyper long-term investment goals like retirement. Imagine this; you set retirement as your financial goal. As a part of this, you \\ndo your bit diligently, i.e. select your mutual funds carefully, save regularly, \\n  \\n\\n \\nincrement your savings by the year, and stick to the course and not succumb \\nto the temptation of pulling out the funds during the tenure. \\nHowever, the country you reside in happens to default on its borrowings and \\nsuﬀers from never-ending geopolitical and civil unrest. \\nGiven the situation, do you think your savings will do well? \\nOr think about a situation in your country at the cusp of a big bang economic \\nreform, with an extremely supportive demographic profile and a \\nsuper-competent Government. But you fail to see through these shining \\nopportunities and instead decide to play safe and invest your hard-earned \\nmoney in gold. \\nDo you think you’d have taken the right investment decision here? \\nHence, for this reason, I think it is very important for an individual to \\nunderstand the basic macroeconomic profile of the country and map it to the \\npast macroeconomic profile and extrapolate a bit to the future and see how \\nthe situation pans out. \\nIn this chapter, I’ll stick to basics and help you understand the absolute \\nessential macroeconomic principles. If the topic interests you’d, I’d suggest \\nyou pick up any good undergraduate book on macroeconomics and read \\nthrough it. I’m sure you won’t regret it 🙂      \\n  \\n \\n30.2 – Gross Domestic Product (GDP) \\nI understand this is an absolute basic metric to start our discussion, but we \\nwill start with it for the same reason. Many of you may be familiar with it; if \\nyes, please feel free to skip this section. For those who are not familiar with \\n‘GDP’, let me tell you a quick story. \\nA\\x00er my sister’s marriage in 2002, she moved to Coimbatore, Tamil Nadu. I \\nwas in my early 20’s, and I’d o\\x00en make weekend trips to Coimbatore to visit \\nher and spend a few days with her. My sister had a very interesting neighbour \\nin Coimbatore, and she would o\\x00en tell me stories about them. On one of my \\nvisits, I got to meet the neighbours as well. \\nThe neighbour’s house had three family members – husband and wife, both \\nin their mid 50’s and a teenage daughter. Husband managed a steel \\nkitchenware shop, which sold household items like rice cooker, pots, and \\npans. His wife managed a small homemade papad and pickle business, and \\nthe teenage daughter taught classical dance to the neighbourhood kids. \\nAll three members of the house had an economic output. Given my \\nunnecessary curiosity, I remember trying to figure out how much money this \\nfamily made. I don’t remember the exact math, but I remember these \\nnumbers; I estimated that – \\n○ The husband sold goods worth 2 to 2.5L lakhs per month. \\n○ The wife sold goods worth 25K every month. \\n○ The daughter charged 500 per month per kid and had ten \\nstudents, which was 5K per month. \\n  \\n \\nGive or take, this small and admirable family’s monthly income was anywhere \\nbetween 2.3 to 2.8L per month or about 34L per year on a gross basis. This \\nfamily had no other source of income. In other words, 34L was the total \\neconomic output of this family a\\x00er accounting for all the products and \\nservices collectively sold by this family.  \\nIn a sense, I think it is ok to conclude that the family’s Gross Domestic \\nProduct' (GDP) was 34L per year.  If you realized, GDP here represents the \\ntotal value of the economic output of the family, which includes goods sold \\n(kitchenware), products manufactured and sold (papad and pickle), and \\nservices oﬀered (dance classes). \\nNow step aside and think about the country as a whole. The country has \\nmany factories, companies, services units of various kinds; all of these \\ncollectively have an economic output. The combined economic value of all \\nthese entities (operating within the geographic boundaries of the country) \\n  \\n \\nrepresents the GDP of the country. If the companies do well and thrive, then \\nnaturally, the GDP of the country increases. \\nOr in other words, a growing GDP is a healthy economic sign. We all want the \\nGDP of the country to increase. \\nHave a look at the Indian GDP ranking –  \\nI’ve got this from Wikipedia, where they have tabulated the 2020 GDP rank of \\ncountries as per various estimates (IMF, World Bank, and UN). \\nIndia ranks around 6th or 5th, and the GDP itself is pegged to 2.6 to 2.9 \\nTrillion USD. Do recollect, the collective economic output of India is \\nestimated between 2.6 – 2.9 Trillion USD. We are just below China, Japan, UK, \\nand Germany. \\nWhile it is great to know we are in the top 5 GDPs of the world, it is also \\nimportant to understand how our GDP grows. A\\x00er all, we want to be better \\nthan being in the top 5, and we want to get there as quickly as possible. \\nTo measure the speed at which a country’s GDP is growing, we need a growth \\nrate. The number is usually expressed in percentage terms. Hence, if the \\npercentage is 5%, it implies that a country’s GDP grows at 5%. \\n  \\n \\nThe technique of estimating the GDP growth rate is beyond this discussion’s \\nscope; we won’t get into that today but will use the widely accepted number. \\nNow, when it comes to measuring the GDP growth, there are two terms you \\nshould familiarize yourself with – \\n○ The nominal GDP growth rate \\n○ The real GDP growth rate \\nBoth these growth rates measure the speed at which the GDP grows; if you \\nguessed right, these rates are the CAGR of the GDP. Do recollect; we have \\ndiscussed CAGR several times in this module. \\nTo put this in context, take a look at this new paper headlines –    The reference point here is the ‘nominal growth’ rate. \\nThe nominal growth rate is the absolute growth rate. While it is ok to use the \\nnominal growth rate, it may not be an accurate representation of ground \\nrealities. \\nLet me explain. \\n  \\n \\nThink of it as investing Rs.100 in stock. At a 10% growth rate and five years, \\nRs.100 grows to Rs.161/-. But is the value of Rs.161/- in 5 years the same as \\nRs.161/- today? Won’t it be right? And we know it won’t be the same because \\ninflation eats into the purchasing power of money on year on year basis. \\nHence to get the most accurate representation, we need to adjust the growth \\nrate to inflation. When we adjust the nominal GDP growth rate to inflation in \\nGDP, we get the real GDP growth rate. \\nReal GDP growth = Nominal GDP growth – Inflation. \\nAssuming the inflation at around 4.5% (ranges between 4.5% to 5%), real GDP \\nof India – \\n10% – 4.5% \\n= 5.5% \\nDo take a look at this snapshot; it estimates the real GDP growth at 5% –  \\nThe snapshot is from the Department of Economic Aﬀairs; you can read the \\nentire paper here –  https://dea.gov.in/sites/default/files/March%202020.pdf . \\nI also found this interesting chart from the same paper; I thought I’d share it \\nhere for your quick reference – \\n  \\n  \\nThanks to COVID, most of the economies (from the GDP perspective) took a \\nhit in 2020. But they are all expected to bounce back up in 2021 and perhaps \\n2022. Whether this will pan out as per estimates or not is an unknown. But the \\nstock markets at least seem to factor this 🙂 Anyway, at this point, I want you to take a break and think about this – \\n○ You understood what GDP is \\n○ You understood the GDP growth rate, both nominal and real. \\nHow is this relevant to personal finance? \\n30.3 – GDP and Market cap \\nWe have discussed the concept of market cap earlier in Varsity. For those of \\nyou not familiar with market cap, here is a quick note – \\n  \\n \\nAssume the stock price of a certain company is Rs.75/- per share. Further, \\nassume that the company has only 1000 shares outstanding of this company. \\nThe market cap of this company is – \\nStock price x total outstanding shares \\n= 75 x 1000 \\n= Rs.75,000/- \\nThe total outstanding shares of this company are constant, but the stock price fluctuates daily. The higher the stock price, the higher is the market cap and \\nvice versa. Now assume another company has 2000 shares outstanding, and the stock \\nprice is 105 per share. The market cap of this company is – \\n= 105 x 2000 \\n=2,10,000/- \\nNow assume (the last assumption, I promise) that the entire market \\ncomprises just these two companies. The entire market cap of this market is – \\n75000 + 210000 \\n=2,85,000/- \\nHopefully, with this arbitrary example, you got a sense of the concept of \\n‘market cap of the market’. The market cap of Indian companies (sum of the market cap of all the listed companies in the country) as of Jan 2021 is \\nroughly $2.5 Trillion. \\n  \\n  \\nOne of the direct established correlations is that as the country’s GDP \\nimproves, so will the market cap. If the market cap does well, then equity \\ninvestments are bound to well. We have seen this happen in the past. \\nSo when you look at the GDP data, think about how the country is placed in \\nterms of GDP, and it is expected to do over the next 5 or 10 years. \\nFor instance, here is a thought about the Indian GDP situation – \\n○ India is a 2.6 Trillion USD GDP as of 2021 \\n○ The real GDP growth rate is 5.5% \\n○ The countries above us in the GDP rank, i.e. Japan, Germany, and \\nthe UK, have large GDPs, but their real growth rates are lower. Even if India did nothing spectacular or did nothing stupid to degrow, then \\nunder a decent real GDP growth rate (and slow down in developed countries), the GDP rank is bound to increase.    \\n  \\n \\nNo think about a growing GDP plus the largest democracy globally, and top it \\nup with a large working population; what do you expect? \\nWell, these are factors that usually are a precursor to attracting more investment capital into the country. With these investments coming in, \\ncorporates are expected to do well, and in turn, the country’s market cap is \\nexpected to do well. \\nWill this happen overnight? No. \\nWill this happen over the next 1-2 years? Maybe not. \\nWill this happen over the next 8-10 years? Well, it seems likely. \\nHence, the need to stay invested for a longer-term. \\n30.4 – India Inc \\nThink about a corporate entity. A corporate entity or a company usually has \\nfew sources of revenue and a set of expenses. The diﬀerence between the \\nrevenue and expense, if positive, results in a profit to the company. If the \\ndiﬀerence between the revenue and expense is negative, then that is a loss to \\nthe company. \\nNow think about India as a company. The company’s management is the \\nGovernment, which is democratically elected. The company has a few \\nrevenue sources, mainly in terms of taxes, and the company also has \\nexpenses mainly in terms of capital and revenue expenses. If the income \\nminus expense is positive, that’s a surplus to the country, else a deficit. \\n  \\n \\nTake a look at the snapshot below; I’ve got this from the website of Controller \\nGeneral of Accounts; here is the link – \\nhttp://www.cga.nic.in/GlanceReport/Published/2018-2019.aspx  \\nThe data you see above is for the Financial Year 2018-19, represented in \\nRupee Crores. Let us break this down to understand the numbers better. \\nThe first line here details India Inc’s Revenue; it is called the ‘Revenue \\nReceipts’. These receipts act as the sources of revenue for the Government. \\nThere are two broad categories of revenue for the Government, i.e. Taxes and \\nNon-tax revenue. \\nTaxes Revenue – Tax revenue includes all sorts of taxes that the Government \\ncollects. Broadly, taxes can be classified as ‘Direct Taxes’ and ‘Indirect Taxes’. \\n  \\n \\nThe direct taxes include taxes paid by individuals, called the ‘Personal Income \\ntaxes’ and the corporates’ taxes, called the ‘Corporate Income tax’. \\nIndirect taxes mainly include the tax in the form of ‘GST’. \\nAs you can see, India Inc collected close to 14.8L Crore as taxes in 2018-19; \\nthis includes both direct and indirect taxes. \\nRemember, when GST is charged, a portion goes to the state and a portion to \\nthe centre. Hence when you look at 14.8LCr, this is the ‘net to the centre’, \\nwhich means that the actual tax collection is higher than 14.8L Cr. Of course, \\nyou can get the exact value by inspecting this report further, but I’ll refrain from doing so. But if I remember right, roughly 2/3rd is retained by the centre, \\n1/3 is distributed to states. \\nNon-tax revenue – Apart from the tax revenue, the Government has a ‘non-tax \\nrevenue’ as an income source. The non-tax revenue source mainly includes \\nthe dividends paid out by the PSU companies (companies like LIC, NTPCL, \\nONGC, NALCO etc.), where the Government of India is a majority stakeholder. \\nApart from dividend income, the Government also has revenue by selling \\nstakes in these companies, o\\x00en referred to as the disinvestment program. \\nThe non-tax revenue for 2018-19 was roughly 2.4L Cr. \\nTotal revenue is the sum of these two revenue lines, which is roughly 18.2L Cr. \\nThe Government has expenses, and these expenses can be categorized into \\ntwo buckets, i.e. the ‘Revenue Expenditure’ and ‘Capital Expenditure. \\nRevenue Expenditure – These expenditures include subsidies across various \\nGovernment schemes, salaries to Govt employees, interest payments etc. The \\n  \\n \\nrevenue expenditure is a big bill that the Govt has to pay, and as we can see \\nfrom the snapshot, this bill stood at 21.4L. \\nCapital Expenditure – The capital expenditure, on the other hand, is the \\nGovernment’s expenditure on infrastructure; this includes things like roads, \\nbridges, hospitals, electrical grids, transportation etc. The capital expenditure \\nis 3.1L Crore. \\nThink about it, capital expenditure is 3.1L Cr, while the revenue expenditure is \\nnearly seven times more at 21L Cr. If the Govt were to spend more on Capital \\nexpenditure, it leads to better infrastructure, spurs business growth, creates \\njobs, and leads to better tax collection. \\nAs a long-term investor, you need to keep track of trends in these spend \\npatterns and get a sense of how the country is evolving. \\nThe sum of revenue and capital expenditure is the total expenditure of the \\nGovt, which is roughly 24.57Cr. \\nSo, on the one hand, Govt collected revenue of 18.2L Cr, and on the other \\nhand, the expenses stood at 24.57Cr. The expenses are much higher than the \\nincome. The negative diﬀerence, i.e. to the extent of nearly 6.3L Cr, is called \\nthe ‘Fiscal Deficit’. \\nFrom the same report, I’ve pulled the GDP data – \\n  \\n  \\nThe country’s GDP as per 2018-19 data is 190.1L Crore. If you calculate the \\nFiscal Deficit as a percentage of GDP – \\n6.3L Cr / 190.1L Cr \\n= 3.3% \\nAny macroeconomic debate or discussion, this is the ratio that gets spoken \\nabout the most. The Government puts in massive eﬀorts to contain the Fiscal \\nDeficit to GDP ratio to sub 4%. \\nTo put this in perspective, do check this extract from Wikipedia –  \\nThe US’s fiscal deficit as a percentage of GDP is nearly 4.7%, which is quite \\nstaggering. \\n  \\n \\nWhile at it, we can crunch one more data point, i.e. net tax collected as a \\npercentage of GDP – \\n= 17.3/190.1 \\n= 9.1% \\nIf we include the share of state’s, this ratio is roughly at 11-12%. Tax collection \\nas a percentage of GDP is an important metric; remember, the higher the tax \\ncollection, the higher is the revenue, which means the probability of \\nshrinking the fiscal deficit is higher. \\nSo what will lead to higher tax collection? Things like newer job creation, \\nbusiness expansion, improvement in ease of doing business, greater \\ncompliance, etc., result in higher tax collection. \\nAgain, to remind you, you need to track these numbers to understand how \\nthe country operates. Remember, when you invest in the long term, your \\nfortunes depend on how your investments perform, depending on how India \\nas a country performs. \\nWithout a sense of these basic details, it is equivalent to investing in the dark. \\nI’ll end this discussion here; as you can imagine, the topic is vast, and we have \\nonly scratched the surface 🙂 With this, we are at the end of this module on the Personal Finance module; I \\nhope you’d enjoyed reading this, as much I enjoyed writing this for you. \\nGood luck and invest wisely 🙂   \\n  \\n \\nKey takeaways from this chapter \\n● The country’s GDP represents the country’s collective \\neconomic output; this includes all the goods and services \\nproduced within the country’s geographic boundary. \\n● The nominal GDP growth rate is the GDP’s absolute growth \\nrate; it does not adjust for inflation. \\n● The real GDP growth rate adjusts for inflation. \\n● With 2.6 to 2.9 Trillion USD, India’s GDP stands at \\n5th/6thposition in the global GDP rank. \\n● As the GDP of the country expands, the market cap also tends to expand. \\n● India Inc’s revenue consists of tax and non-tax revenue. \\n● India, Inc’s expense consists of revenue and capital \\nexpenditure.   \\n  \""

              "\"Based on the context, it seems that your friend is offering you a choice between receiving Rs. 1,00,000 today or Rs. 50,000 every month for 2 years. The question is, which option is better?To answer this, we need to consider the time value of money. The time value of money is a fundamental concept in finance that states that money today is more valuable than money in the future. This is because money today can be invested to generate returns, such as interest or dividends, which can increase its value over time.Let's consider the two options:Option A: Rs. 1,00,000 today\\nOption B: Rs. 50,000 every month for 2 yearsTo make a fair comparison, we need to find the present value of the monthly payments in Option B. The present value of a future cash flow is the amount of money that is equivalent to the future cash flow, given a certain discount rate.Assuming a discount rate of 7.5% (which is a reasonable rate for a 2-year investment), we can calculate the present value of the monthly payments as follows:Present value of Rs. 50,000/month for 24 months = Rs. 8,35,441Now, let's compare the two options:Option A: Rs. 1,00,000 today\\nOption B: Rs. 8,35,441 (present value of monthly payments)Based on the calculation, Option B is equivalent to Rs. 8,35,441 today, which is more than the Rs. 1,00,000 offered in Option A. This means that Option B is the better option, as it provides a higher value today.However, it's important to note that this calculation assumes a 7.5% discount rate, which may not reflect the actual returns that you could earn on your investment. Additionally, there may be other factors to consider, such as the risk of the investment or the opportunity cost of tying up your money for 2 years.Ultimately, the decision depends on your personal financial goals and risk tolerance. If you are comfortable with the risk and believe that the monthly payments will provide a higher return than the lump sum, then Option B may be the better choice. But if you prefer a more conservative approach and are willing to accept a lower return, then Option A may be the better option.\""
