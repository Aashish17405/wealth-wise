The corpus that you intend to build at the end of the defined period is sensitive to the rate of \\nreturn the investment generates. A small variation to rate can have a big impact on the corpus\\n3. Choose an instrument that best suits your risk and return appetite\\n4. Equity should be a part of your investment if you want to beat the inflation in the long run           8 \\n∏\\n2.1 - What is a stock market? • Investing in equities is an important investment that we make in order to generate inflation \\nbeating returns. This was the conclusion we drew from the previous chapter. Having said that, \\nhow do we go about investing in equities? Clearly before we dwell further into this topic, it is ex-\\ntremely important to understand the ecosystem in which equities operate. Just like the way we go to the neighborhood kirana store or a super market to shop for our daily \\nneeds, similarly we go to the stock market to shop (read as transact) for equity investments. Stock market is where everyone who wants to transact in shares go to. Transact in simple terms \\nmeans buying and selling. For all practical purposes, you can’t buy/sell shares of a public com-\\npany like Infosys without transacting through the stock markets. The main purpose of the stock market is to help you facilitate your transactions. So if you are a \\nbuyer of a share, the stock market helps you meet the seller and vice versa. Now unlike a super market, the stock market does not exist in a brick and mortar form. It exists in \\nelectronic form. You access the market electronically from your computer and go about conduct-\\ning your transactions (buying and selling of shares). Regulators \\n9\\nCHAPTER 2\\n\\n\\nAlso, it is important to note that you can access the stock market via a registered intermediary \\ncalled the stock broker. We will discuss more about the stock brokers at a later point. There are two main stock exchanges in India that make up the stock markets. They are the Bom-\\nbay Stock Exchange (BSE) and the National Stock Exchange (NSE). Besides these two exchanges \\nthere are a bunch of other regional stock exchanges like Bangalore Stock Exchange, Madras Stock \\nExchange that are more or less getting phased out and don’t really play any meaningful role any-\\nmore. 2.2 - Stock Market Participants and the need to regulate them\\nThe stock market attracts individuals and corporations from diverse backgrounds. Anyone who \\ntransacts in the stock market is called a market participant. The market participant can be classi-\\nfied into various categories. Some of the categories of market participants are as follows:\\n1. Domestic Retail Participants – These are people like you and me transacting in markets\\n2. NRI’s and OCI – These are people of Indian origin but based outside India\\n3. Domestic Institutions – These are large corporate entities based in India. Classic example \\nwould be the LIC of India. 4. Domestic Asset Management Companies (AMC) – Typical participants in this category \\nwould be the mutual fund companies such as SBI Mutual Fund, DSP Black Rock, Fidelity \\nInvestments, HDFC AMC etc. 5. Foreign Institutional Investors – Non Indian corporate entities. These could be foreign \\nasset management companies, hedge funds and other investors\\nNow, irrespective of the category of market participant the agenda for everyone is the same – to \\nmake profitable transactions.'),\n",

However, do keep these assumptions in the \\nback of your mind: \\no Buy strength and sell weakness – Strength is represented by a bullish (blue) \\ncandle and weakness by a bearish (red) candle. Hence whenever you are buying \\nensure it is a blue candle day and whenever you are selling, ensure it’s a red candle \\nday. o Be flexible with patterns (quantify and verify) – While the text book definition of \\na pattern could state a certain criteria, there could be minor variations to the \\npattern owing to market conditions. So one needs to be a bit flexible. However one \\nneeds to be flexible within limits, and hence it is required to always quantify the \\nflexibility. o Look for a prior trend – If you are looking at a bullish pattern, the prior trend \\nshould be bearish and likewise if you are looking for a bearish pattern, the prior \\ntrend should be bullish.
